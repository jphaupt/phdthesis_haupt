x Figure 5.1: incongruence caption/text: is it avdz or avtz?
x Caption Figure 5.1: "the nonsmooth points ... is" -> "are"

chapter 4.9.1: xTC also approximates the densities as an antisymmetrized product of the one-body density matrix.

x After equation 5.9: we only use the one-body density in xTC

Could mention the non-convergence of MRCI-D-F12 in the text. But don't think it's necessary.

x Figure 5.6: Not sure about the final sentence. We do not have HEAT values for any points other than the equilbrium or full dissociation.

x Table 5.1 Shouldn't the VMC error be 0.3 mHa (N2 + N + N)?

x "used to then determinant the 1RDM" -> determine

x Figure 5.7: what is E_exc?

x Figure 5.7: Legend for basis sets barely shows the pattern for avtz

x Figure 5.7: "for each states" -> "state"

x Is there a way to make figures 5.7 and 5.8 as well as table 5.3 appear close to their mention in the text?

Other than that I think it's very well written and especially easily digestible. Far too often when going through the thesis of someone I have to tell them not to write sentences that go on for half a paragraph. Didn't notice any of that here.
