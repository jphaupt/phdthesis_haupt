For the thesis:
- [ ] collect data so far 20250127
  - [ ] binding curve N2 avtz
    - [ ] fciqmc-jastrow
    - [ ] casscf-jastrow
    - [ ] casci-jastrow
    - [ ] rhf-jastrow (not as important)
  - [ ] excited states (I think N2)
- [ ] avdz, avtz
  - [ ] maybe vtz just to show the augmented basis is necessary
- [ ] excited states
  - [ ] N2
  - [ ] ammonia
  - [ ] active-space-only calculations
- [ ] redo anomalous point in rhf curve
- [ ] run the casscf jastrows from pyscf

For the paper:
- [ ] hammer down trial wave function xTC-FCIQMC calculations
- [ ] time-averaged CI vector?
- [ ] replica-averaged CI vector (maybe not a good idea if we have degenerate eigenvectors?)
- [ ] really hammer down FCIQMC non-TC
- [ ] one other molecule's excited states
- [ ] basis sets: avdz, avtz, avqz
