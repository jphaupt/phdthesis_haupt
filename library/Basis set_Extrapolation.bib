  abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation\hphantom{,}consistent\hphantom{,}basis\hphantom{,}sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

  abstract = {The leading cause of error in standard coupled cluster theory calculations of thermodynamic properties such as atomization energies and heats of formation originates with the truncation of the one-particle basis set expansion. Unfortunately, the use of finite basis sets is currently a computational necessity. Even with basis sets of quadruple zeta quality, errors can easily exceed 8 kcal/mol in small molecules, rendering the results of little practical use. Attempts to address this serious problem have led to a wide variety of proposals for simple complete basis set extrapolation formulas that exploit the regularity in the correlation consistent sequence of basis sets. This study explores the effectiveness of six formulas for reproducing the complete basis set limit. The W4 approach was also examined, although in lesser detail. Reference atomization energies were obtained from standard coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) calculations involving basis sets of 6ζ or better quality for a collection of 141 molecules. In addition, a subset of 51 atomization energies was treated with explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b calculations and very large basis sets. Of the formulas considered, all proved reliable at reducing the one-particle expansion error. Even the least effective formulas cut the error in the raw values by more than half, a feat requiring a much larger basis set without the aid of extrapolation. The most effective formulas cut the mean absolute deviation by a further factor of two. Careful examination of the complete body of statistics failed to reveal a single choice that out performed the others for all basis set combinations and all classes of molecules.},

Correlation-consistent polarized valence and core-valence basis sets up to sextuple zeta quality are employed.

  abstract = {The basis-set convergence towards the numerical limit of the Hartree–Fock total energy and binding energy is investigated for the correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets. For both energies, solid improvements are obtained with each increment in X. The basis-set errors for the total energy (ΔE) fit an exponential form better than a power form, and the total energy is better fitted than the binding energy. It is difficult to find generally reliable extrapolation schemes for the total energy. In most cases, the most successful scheme gives results extrapolated beyond a given X that are comparable to the cc-pV(X+1)Z results, but occasionally it fails dramatically for large X. Indeed, explicit calculation of the energy in a larger basis set, especially the cc-pV6Z set for which ΔE⩽0.1 mEh, gives the most reliable estimate of the basis-set limit.},

The basis-set limits of the correlation energy are established to within 2\,mEh by means of (1) extrapolations from sequences of calculations using correlation-consistent basis sets and (2) from explicitly correlated calculations employing terms linear in the interelectronic distances rij.

  abstract = {Using systematic sequences of correlation consistent Gaussian basis sets from double to sextuple zeta quality, the classical barrier height of the H+H2 exchange reaction has been calculated by multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods. The MRCI calculations for collinear H3 have also been calibrated against large basis set full CI (FCI) results, which demonstrate that the MRCI treatment leads to energies less than 1 μhartree (≤0.001 kcal/mol) above the FCI energies. The dependence of both the H2 and H3 total energies on the basis set is found to be very regular, and this behavior has been used to extrapolate to the complete basis set (CBS) limits. The resulting estimate of the H–H–H CBS limit yields a classical barrier height, relative to exact H+H2, of 9.60±0.02 kcal/mol; the best directly calculated value for the barrier is equal to 9.62 kcal/mol. These results are in excellent agreement with recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations.},
