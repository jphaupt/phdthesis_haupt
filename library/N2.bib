  abstract = {The molecular constants of the electronic ground state of molecular nitrogen have been updated by combining published high-resolution data with the results from recently recorded high-resolution vacuum ultraviolet emission spectra. These constants have been obtained from a weighted least-squares fit to the Dunham formula with constraints imposed on the higher order terms. An extensive list of rovibrational level energies is given for the first time. These results have been used to calculate a new RKR potential curve for this state and comparisons are made with previous studies.},

  abstract = {Two types of combined-isotopologue analysis have been performed on an extensive spectroscopic data set for ground-state N2 involving levels up to v=19, which is bound by half the well depth. Both a conventional Dunham-type analysis and a direct-potential-fit (DPF) analysis represent the data within (on average) the estimated experimental uncertainties. However, the Dunham-type parameters do not yield realistic predictions outside the range of the data used in the analysis, while the potential function obtained from the DPF treatment yields quantum mechanical accuracy over the data region and realistic predictions of the energies and properties of unobserved higher vibrational levels. Our DPF analysis also introduces a compact new analytic potential function form which incorporates the two leading inverse-power terms in the long-range potential.},

  abstract = {Relying on a 56-dimensional reference space and using up to the correlation-consistent, polarized, valence-quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) basis sets, the reduced multireference (RMR) coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (CCSD), as well as its perturbatively corrected version for secondary triples [RMR CCSD(T)], is employed to generate the full potential energy curves for the nitrogen molecule. The resulting potentials are then compared to the recently published accurate analytic potential based on an extensive experimental data analysis [R. J. Le Roy et al., J. Chem. Phys.\hphantom{,}125, 164310 (2006)], and the vibrational term values of these potentials are compared over the entire well. A comparison with single-reference CCSD and CCSD(T) results, as well as with earlier obtained eight-reference RMR CC results, is also made. Excellent performance of RMR CCSD, and its systematic improvement with the increasing dimension of the reference space employed, is demonstrated. For the first 19 vibrationally excited levels, which are based on experimentally observed bands, we find an absolute average deviation of 8\enspace cm−1 from the computed RMR CCSD/cc-pVQZ values. The perturbative correction for triples increases this deviation to 126\enspace cm−1, but only to 61\enspace cm−1 when extrapolated to the basis set limit. Both RMR CCSD and RMR CCSD(T) potentials perform well when compared to the experiment-based analytic potential in the entire range of internuclear separations.},
