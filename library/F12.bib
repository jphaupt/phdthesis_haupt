  abstract = {By performing a stochastic dynamic in a space of Slater determinants, the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method has been able to obtain energies which are essentially free from systematic error to the basis set correlation energy, within small and systematically improvable error bars. However, the weakly exponential scaling with basis size makes converging the energy with respect to basis set costly and in larger systems, impossible. To ameliorate these basis set issues, here we use perturbation theory to couple the FCIQMC wavefunction to an explicitly correlated strongly orthogonal basis of geminals, following the \$\{ [2]\_\{\textbackslash textrm \{R12\}\} \}\$[2]R12 approach of Valeev et al. The required one- and two-particle density matrices are computed on-the-fly during the FCIQMC dynamic, using a sampling procedure which incurs relatively little additional computation expense. The F12 energy corrections are shown to converge rapidly as a function of sampling, both in imaginary time and number of walkers. Our pilot calculations on the binding curve for the carbon dimer, which exhibits strong correlation effects as well as substantial basis set dependence, demonstrate that the accuracy of the FCIQMC-F12 method surpasses that of all previous FCIQMC calculations, and that the F12 correction improves results equivalent to increasing the quality of the one-electron basis by two cardinal numbers.},

Since Hylleraas first used an explicitly correlated wave function for the He atom in 1929, numerous attempts have been made to tackle the significant challenges involved in constructing practical explicitly correlated methods that are applicable to larger systems. These include identifying suitable mathematical forms of a correlated wave function and an efficient evaluation of many-electron integrals. R12 theory, which employs the resolution of the identity approximation, emerged in 1985, followed by the introduction of novel correlation factors and wave function ansätze, leading to the establishment of F12 theory in the 2000s. Rapid progress in recent years has significantly extended the application range of explicitly correlated theory, offering the potential of an accurate wave-function treatment of complex systems such as photosystems and semiconductors. This perspective surveys explicitly correlated electronic structure theory, with an emphasis on recent stochastic and deterministic approaches that hold significant promise for applications to large and complex systems including solids.},

  abstract = {The Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method has proved able to provide near-exact solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equation within a finite orbital basis set, without relying on an expansion about a reference state. However, a drawback to the approach is that being based on an expansion of Slater determinants, the FCIQMC method suffers from a basis set incompleteness error that decays very slowly with the size of the employed single particle basis. The FCIQMC results obtained in a small basis set can be improved significantly with explicitly correlated techniques. Here, we present a study that assesses and compares two contrasting “universal” explicitly correlated approaches that fit into the FCIQMC framework: the [2]R12 method of Kong and Valeev [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 214105 (2011)] and the explicitly correlated canonical transcorrelation approach of Yanai and Shiozaki [J. Chem. Phys. 136, 084107 (2012)]. The former is an a posteriori internally contracted perturbative approach, while the latter transforms the Hamiltonian prior to the FCIQMC simulation. These comparisons are made across the 55 molecules of the G1 standard set. We found that both methods consistently reduce the basis set incompleteness, for accurate atomization energies in small basis sets, reducing the error from 28 mEh to 3-4 mEh. While many of the conclusions hold in general for any combination of multireference approaches with these methodologies, we also consider FCIQMC-specific advantages of each approach.},

  abstract = {The past few years have seen a particularly rich period in the development of the explicitly correlated R12 theories of electron correlation. These theories bypass the slow convergence of conventional methods, by augmenting the traditional orbital expansions with a small number of terms that depend explicitly on the interelectronic distance r 12. Amongst the very numerous discoveries and developments that we will review here, two stand out as being of particular interest. First, the fundamental numerical approximations of the R12 methods withstand the closest scrutiny: Kutzelnigg's use of the resolution of the identity and the generalized Brillouin condition to avoid many-electronic integrals remains sound. Second, it transpires that great gains in accuracy can be made by changing the dependence on the interelectronic coordinate from linear (r 12) to some suitably chosen short-range form (e.g., exp(−αr 12)). Modern R12 (or F12) methods can deliver MP2 energies (and beyond) that are converged to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) in triple- or even double-zeta basis sets. Using a range of approximations, applications to large molecules become possible. Here, the major developments in the field are reviewed, and recommendations for future directions are presented. By comparing with commonly used extrapolation techniques, it is shown that modern R12 methods can deliver high accuracy dramatically faster than by using conventional methods. Contents PAGE 1.

  abstract = {The calculation of the electronic structure of molecules solely from first principles is a subject of intensive research programs worldwide. The goal of these efforts is to develop efficient computational methods for determining molecular properties. Such methods are based on quantum mechanical many-body methods, which allow for a correct description of the complex correlated motion of electrons. However, despite the immense advances in the computational capabilities during the last decades, highly accurate calculations are still limited to molecules containing no more than ten to twenty atoms. In this context, one of the most severe problems is that the intrinsic accuracy of the employed many-body methods is generally hard to reach in practical calculations. This is a side effect of the expansion of molecular wave functions in terms of a finite basis of one-particle functions ("molecular orbitals"): A large number of basis functions per atom is required for accurately describing the microstructure of the wave function which is caused by the divergent Coulomb interaction. Calculations become very expensive very quickly. Explicitly correlated methods offer a promising approach to circumvent this problem of basis set convergence. Basically, such methods are variants of the common many-body methods of quantum mechanics (e.g., perturbation theory or Coupled Cluster methods) in which the common wave function ansatz is extended by additional terms which contain the inter-electronic distance explicitly. Methods of this form with a potential for routine applications were first proposed by Kutzelnigg and Klopper in 1991. During the last years the explicitly correlated methods were developed to such a degree that they now can clearly surpass the accuracy-to-cost ratio of their conventional counterparts. Such explicitly correlated methods were developed as a part of this dissertation. Concretely, open-shell variants of Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and of Coupled Cluster Singles \& Doubles were produced. Apart from that, also theoretical aspects are discussed, like the interpretation of F12 wave functions or special issues arising when handling open-shell species. Also technical aspects are considered, like the robust solution of the occurring equation systems and the avoidance of numerical problems. Furthermore, methods are developed to correct for Hartree-Fock basis set deviations in the context of explicitly correlated calculations, and simple approximations are investigated which accelerate the basis set convergence of perturbative triple excitations in Coupled Cluster calculations. Extensive benchmark calculations are essential for facilitating the practical application of new calculation methods. This applies particularly if the new methods are supposed to have a "black box" character, like it is the case here. As a consequence, a great part of this work is concerned with performing and evaluating calculations, in order to establish the accuracy of the developed methods and in order to derive optimal default calculation parameters. In this regard, different families of atomic orbital basis sets are investigated for their compatibility with F12 calculations, and the effect of the free length scale parameter of the theory is quantified. In pursuance of a wide range of application scenarios, the new methods are tested on a great variety of different calculation tasks. A special emphasis is placed on difficult problems, like the calculation of atomization energies, of electron affinities and ionization potentials, and of potential energy curves of diatomic molecules and of atomic dipole polarizabilities. The quantum chemical methods developed here can reduce the computational cost of highly accurate calculations by more than two order of magnitude since, due to their fast basis set convergence, less basis functions are required to achieve a desired accuracy. Therefore this work significantly extends the range of molecules for which such highly accurate calculations are possible.},

The energy increments E l (2) corresponding to the partial wave expansion of χ go asymptotically as l−8, while conventional partial wave increments go as l−4. χ is coupled to Φ by a “residual” interaction U12 that has no singularity for r12=0. With the present ansatz it is sufficient to include l-values up to 5 in order to get the second-order energy accurate to one microhartree. For the same accuracy l≤4 is sufficient in a “CI with correlated reference function” while in conventional CI one must go to l∼50. The surprisingly faster convergence of the variational approach as compared to second-order perturbation theory is explained. The slow convergence of the traditional partial wave expansion is entirely due to the attempt to represent the quantity 1=〈Φ¦r12r12 −1¦Φ〉 by its partial wave expansion. The best reference function Φ shows very little shielding and resembles closely the eigenstate of the bare nuclear Hamiltonian. The generalization to arbitrary systems is discussed and it is pointed out that the calculation of “difficult” integrals can be avoided without a significant loss in accuracy.},

The two-particle cumulant λ2 describes two-particle correlations (excluding exchange), λ3 genuine three-particle correlations etc. The properties of these cumulants are analyzed. Conditions for vanishing of certain λk are formulated. Necessary and sufficient for λ2=0 is the well-known idempotency condition γ2=γ for γ≡γ1. For λ3=0 to hold, a general necessary condition is Tr\{2γ3−3γ2+γ\}=0, for three special forms of the wave function (arbitrary two-electron state, antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals on antisymmetrized geminal power wave function of extreme type) 2γ3−3γ2+γ=0 turns out to be necessary and sufficient. For a multiconfiguration self-consistent field wave function the only nonvanishing matrix elements of the cumulants are those where all labels refer to active (partially occupied) spin orbitals. Spin-free cumulants Λk corresponding to the spin-free reduced density matrices Γk are also defined and analyzed. The main interest in the density cumulants is in connection with the recently formulated normal ordering and the corresponding Wick theorem for arbitrary reference functions, but they are also useful for an analysis of electron correlation.},

  abstract = {A generalization of normal ordering and of Wick’s theorem with respect to an arbitrary reference function Φ as some generalized “physical vacuum” is formulated in a different (but essentially equivalent) way than that suggested previously by one of the present authors. Guiding principles are that normal order operators with respect to any reference state must be expressible as linear combinations of those with respect to the genuine vacuum, that the vacuum expectation value of a normal order operator must vanish (with respect to the vacuum to which it is in normal order), and that the well-known formalism for a single Slater determinant as physical vacuum must be contained as a special case. The derivation is largely based on the concepts of “Quantum Chemistry in Fock space,” which means that particle-number-conserving operators (excitation operators) play a central role. Nevertheless, the contraction rules in the frame of a generalized Wick theorem are derived, that hold for non-particle-number-conserving operators as well. The contraction rules are formulated and illustrated in terms of diagrams. The contractions involve the “residual n-particle density matrices” λ, which are the irreducible (non-factorizable) parts of the conventional n-particle density matrices γ, in the sense of a cumulant expansion for the density. A spinfree formulation is presented as well. The expression of the Hamiltonian in normal order with respect to a multiconfiguration reference function leads to a natural definition of a generalized Fock operator. MC-SCF-theory is easily worked out in this context. The paper concludes with a discussion of the excited configurations and the first-order interacting space, that underlies a perturbative coupled cluster type correction to the MCSCF function for an arbitrary reference function, and with general implications of the new formalism, that is related to “internally contracted multireference configuration interaction.” The present generalization of normal ordering is not only valid for arbitrary reference functions, but also if the reference state is an ensemble state.},

  abstract = {In currently most popular explicitly correlated electronic structure theories, the dependence of the wave function on the interelectronic distance rij is built via the correlation factor f\,(rij). While the short-distance behavior of this factor is well understood, little is known about the form of f\,(rij) at large rij. In this work, we investigate the optimal form of f\,(r12) on the example of the helium atom and helium-like ions and several well-motivated models of the wave function. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle, we derive a differential equation for f\,(r12) and solve it using numerical propagation or analytic asymptotic expansion techniques. We found that for every model under consideration, f\,(r12) behaves at large rij as \textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}\textbackslash begin\{document\}\$r\_\{12\}\textasciicircum\textbackslash rho \textbackslash,e\textasciicircum\{B r\_\{12\}\}\$\textbackslash end\{document\}r12ρeBr12 and obtained simple analytic expressions for the system dependent values of ρ and B. For the ground state of the helium-like ions, the value of B is positive, so that f\,(r12) diverges as r12 tends to infinity. The numerical propagation confirms this result. When the Hartree-Fock orbitals, multiplied by the correlation factor, are expanded in terms of Slater functions rne−βr, n = 0,…,N, the numerical propagation reveals a minimum in f\,(r12) with depth increasing with N. For the lowest triplet state, B is negative. Employing our analytical findings, we propose a new “range-separated” form of the correlation factor with the short- and long-range r12 regimes approximated by appropriate asymptotic formulas connected by a switching function. Exemplary calculations show that this new form of f\,(r12) performs somewhat better than the correlation factors used thus far in the standard R12 or F12 theories.},

In the present work, we examine the reason for this behavior and show that the inclusion of additional orbitals in the construction of the r12 pair functions leads to an enhanced basis set convergence (and thus a balanced description) also for the excited states.},

The Rydberg formula follows from this as in the older theory. The separate Rydberg series for the various multiplets also are explained. The method previously applied by the writer to the helium problem appears as a next approximation, in which the outer electron moves, not in a hydrogen-like field, but in a somewhat more accurate central field. It is shown that this method should give a good approximation to the energy levels, and also to the wave function, except at very small distances. The attempt to use this function as a starting point for perturbation calculations is shown, however, not to be justified, for the matrix of the Hamiltonian function 𝐻, which is used in the perturbation method, greatly magnifies the errors in the wave function. Suggestions are made as to the next step in improving the method, by increasing the accuracy of the wave function for small 𝑟′s.},

  abstract = {We employ the Slater-type function as a geminal basis function to incorporate the inter-electron distance in explicitly correlated theory. It is shown that the use of the Slater-type geminals confers numerical and computational advantages over the previous explicitly correlated methods. The performance of the resulting method is examined in some benchmark calculations at the second order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory. The results reveal that the Slater-type function is promising compared to the ordinary Gaussian-type geminals and linear r12 function.},

  abstract = {We present a Lagrangian correction for the energy change upon releasing constraints imposed on coupled cluster amplitudes. We demonstrate that our correction (i) eliminates the systematic basis set error of the posthoc F12 treatment in orbital optimized methods and (ii) can be used to relax the F12 amplitudes and significantly reduce the sensitivity of the core–valence correlation energies to the exponent of the correlation factor, while retaining the low cost of the fixed amplitude approach.}

The method is based on the transcorrelated (TC) method originally proposed by S. F. Boys and N. C. Handy about 40 years ago for atoms and molecules. In the TC method, one-electron orbitals in a Slater-Jastrow-type many-body wave funtion are fully optimized by solving a mean-field wave equation self-consistently. It is shown that the Hubbard model and also first-principles Hamiltonian can be treated accurately with this simple and tractable method.},

The trial wave functions are chosen to be combinations of correlated Gaussians, which are constructed from products of the single-particle Gaussian wave packets through an integral transformation, thereby facilitating fully analytical calculations of the matrix elements. The nonlinear parameters of the trial function are chosen by a stochastic technique. The method has proved very efficient, virtually exact, and it seems feasible for any few-body bound-state problems emerging in nuclear or atomic physics.},

  abstract = {A general form of orbital invariant explicitly correlated second-order closed-shell Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2-F12) is derived, and compact working equations are presented. Many-electron integrals are avoided by resolution of the identity (RI) approximations using the complementary auxiliary basis set approach. A hierarchy of well defined levels of approximation is introduced, differing from the exact theory by the neglect of terms involving matrix elements over the Fock operator. The most accurate method is denoted as MP2-F12/3B. This assumes only that Fock matrix elements between occupied orbitals and orbitals outside the auxiliary basis set are negligible. For the chosen ansatz for the first-order wave function this is exact if the auxiliary basis is complete. In the next lower approximation it is assumed that the occupied orbital space is closed under action of the Fock operator [generalized Brillouin condition (GBC)]; this is equivalent to approximation 2B of Klopper and Samson [J. Chem. Phys.\hphantom{,}116, 6397 (2002)]. Further approximations can be introduced by assuming the extended Brillouin condition (EBC) or by neglecting certain terms involving the exchange operator. A new approximation MP2-F12/3C, which is closely related to the MP2-R12/C method recently proposed by Kedžuch et al. [Int. J. Quantum Chem.\hphantom{,}105, 929 (2005)] is described. In the limit of a complete RI basis this method is equivalent to MP2-F12/3B. The effect of the various approximations (GBC, EBC, and exchange) is tested by studying the convergence of the correlation energies with respect to the atomic orbital and auxiliary basis sets for 21molecules. The accuracy of relative energies is demonstrated for 16 chemical reactions. Approximation 3C is found to perform equally well as the computationally more demanding approximation 3B. The reaction energies obtained with smaller basis sets are found to be most accurate if the orbital-variant diagonal Ansatz combined with localized orbitals is used for the first-order wave function. This unexpected result is attributed to geminal basis set superposition errors present in the formally more rigorous orbital invariant methods.},

In this model, an orthonormal complementary auxiliary basis set is used for the resolution-of-identity approximation in order to calculate the three-electron integrals needed for CCSD(R12) and CCSD(F12). The additional CCSD(R12) or CCSD(F12) terms introduced within ansatz 2, which are not present in ansatz 1, are derived and discussed with regard to the extra costs needed for their computation. As a first application the basis set convergence of equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies has been investigated for some singlet excited states of the diatomic molecules N2, CO, BF, and BH. The calculated CCSD(F12) results show that the average absolute deviations of the bond lengths and frequencies from the basis set limits are below 0.1 pm and 5\enspace cm−1 as well as 0.05 pm and 1\enspace cm−1 for the triple- and quadruple-ζ basis sets, respectively. These deviations are shown to largely arise from the SCF basis set incompleteness errors.},
