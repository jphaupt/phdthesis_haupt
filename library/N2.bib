  abstract = {The molecular constants of the electronic ground state of molecular nitrogen have been updated by combining published high-resolution data with the results from recently recorded high-resolution vacuum ultraviolet emission spectra. These constants have been obtained from a weighted least-squares fit to the Dunham formula with constraints imposed on the higher order terms. An extensive list of rovibrational level energies is given for the first time. These results have been used to calculate a new RKR potential curve for this state and comparisons are made with previous studies.},

  abstract = {Two types of combined-isotopologue analysis have been performed on an extensive spectroscopic data set for ground-state N2 involving levels up to v=19, which is bound by half the well depth. Both a conventional Dunham-type analysis and a direct-potential-fit (DPF) analysis represent the data within (on average) the estimated experimental uncertainties. However, the Dunham-type parameters do not yield realistic predictions outside the range of the data used in the analysis, while the potential function obtained from the DPF treatment yields quantum mechanical accuracy over the data region and realistic predictions of the energies and properties of unobserved higher vibrational levels. Our DPF analysis also introduces a compact new analytic potential function form which incorporates the two leading inverse-power terms in the long-range potential.},

  abstract = {Relying on a 56-dimensional reference space and using up to the correlation-consistent, polarized, valence-quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) basis sets, the reduced multireference (RMR) coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (CCSD), as well as its perturbatively corrected version for secondary triples [RMR CCSD(T)], is employed to generate the full potential energy curves for the nitrogen molecule. The resulting potentials are then compared to the recently published accurate analytic potential based on an extensive experimental data analysis [R. J. Le Roy et al., J. Chem. Phys.\hphantom{,}125, 164310 (2006)], and the vibrational term values of these potentials are compared over the entire well. A comparison with single-reference CCSD and CCSD(T) results, as well as with earlier obtained eight-reference RMR CC results, is also made. Excellent performance of RMR CCSD, and its systematic improvement with the increasing dimension of the reference space employed, is demonstrated. For the first 19 vibrationally excited levels, which are based on experimentally observed bands, we find an absolute average deviation of 8\enspace cm−1 from the computed RMR CCSD/cc-pVQZ values. The perturbative correction for triples increases this deviation to 126\enspace cm−1, but only to 61\enspace cm−1 when extrapolated to the basis set limit. Both RMR CCSD and RMR CCSD(T) potentials perform well when compared to the experiment-based analytic potential in the entire range of internuclear separations.},

  abstract = {Given access to accurate solutions of the many-electron Schrödinger equation, nearly all chemistry could be derived from first principles. Exact wave functions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wave function approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wave-function Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wave functions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic neural network, as a powerful wave-function Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic neural network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum Monte Carlo Ansatz on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimization of wave functions for previously intractable many-electron systems.},
