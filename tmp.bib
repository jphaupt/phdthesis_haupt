  abstract = {Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. In addition, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing us to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present an extension of popular selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms to the Transcorrelated (TC) framework. Although we used in this work the recently introduced one-parameter correlation factor [E. Giner, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 084119 (2021)], the theory presented here is valid for any correlation factor. Thanks to the formalization of the non-Hermitian TC eigenvalue problem as a search of stationary points for a specific functional depending on both left- and right-functions, we obtain a general framework, allowing for different choices for both the selection criterion in SCI and the second order perturbative correction to the energy. After numerical investigations on different second-row atomic and molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets, we found that taking into account the non-Hermitian character of the TC Hamiltonian in the selection criterion is mandatory to obtain a fast convergence of the TC energy. In addition, selection criteria based on either the first order coefficient or the second order energy lead to significantly different convergence rates, which is typically not the case in the usual Hermitian SCI. Regarding the convergence of the total second order perturbation energy, we find that the quality of the left-function used in the equations strongly affects the quality of the results. Within the near-optimal algorithm proposed here, we find that the SCI expansion in the TC framework converges faster than the usual SCI in terms of both the basis set and the number of Slater determinants.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for a selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithm within a bi-orthogonal basis for transcorrelated (TC) calculations. The bi-orthogonal basis used here serves as the equivalent of the standard Hartree--Fock (HF) orbitals. However, within the context of TC, it leads to distinct orbitals for the left and right vectors. Our findings indicate that the use of such a bi-orthogonal basis allows for a proper definition of the frozen core approximation. In contrast, the use of HF orbitals results in bad error cancellations for ionization potentials and atomization energies (AE). Compared to HF orbitals, the optimized bi-orthogonal basis significantly reduces the positive part of the second-order energy (PT2), thereby facilitating the use of standard extrapolation techniques of hermitian SCI. While we did not observe a significant improvement in the convergence of the SCI algorithm, this is largely due to the use in this work of a simple three-body correlation factor introduced in a recent study. This correlation factor, which depends only on atomic parameters, eliminates the need for re-optimization of the correlation factor for molecular systems, making its use straightforward and user-friendly. Despite the simplicity of this correlation factor, we were able to achieve accurate results on the AE of a series of 14 molecules on a triple-zeta basis. We also successfully broke a double bond until the full dissociation limit while maintaining the size consistency property. This work thus demonstrates the potential of the BiO-TC-SCI approach in handling complex molecular systems.},

In the transcorrelation ansatz, the electronic Hamiltonian is similarity-transformed with a Jastrow factor to describe the cusp in the wave function at electron--electron coalescence. As a result, the wave function is easier to approximate accurately with the conventional expansion in terms of one-particle basis functions and Slater determinants. The transcorrelated Hamiltonian in first quantization comprises up to three-body interactions, which we deal with in the standard way by applying robust density fitting to two- and three-body integrals entering the second-quantized representation of this Hamiltonian. The lack of hermiticity of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is taken care of along the lines of the first work on transcorrelated DMRG [ J. Chem. Phys. 2020, 153, 164115] by encoding it as a matrix product operator and optimizing the corresponding ground state wave function with imaginary-time time-dependent DMRG. We demonstrate our quantum chemical transcorrelated DMRG approach at the example of several atoms and first-row diatomic molecules. We show that transcorrelation improves the convergence rate to the complete basis set limit in comparison to conventional DMRG. Moreover, we study extensions of our approach that aim at reducing the cost of handling the matrix product operator representation of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian.},

We apply this methodology to study the two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions near half filling in the intermediate interaction strength regime (U/t = 4). We show that at optimal or near optimal strength of the Gutzwiller correlator, the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian has extremely compact right eigenvectors, which can be sampled to high accuracy using the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method and its initiator approximation. Near-optimal correlators can be obtained using a simple projective equation, thus obviating the need for a numerical optimization of the correlator. The FCIQMC method, as a projective technique, is well suited for such non-Hermitian problems, and its stochastic nature can handle the three-body interactions exactly without undue increase in computational cost. The highly compact nature of the right eigenvectors means that the initiator approximation in FCIQMC is not severe and that large lattices can be simulated, well beyond the reach of the method applied to the original Hubbard Hamiltonian. Results are provided in lattice sizes up to 50 sites and compared to auxiliary-field QMC. New benchmark results are provided in the off-half-filling regime, with no severe sign problem being encountered. In addition, we show that methodology can be used to calculate excited states of the Hubbard model and lay the groundwork for the calculation of observables other than the energy.},

The benefit of such an approach relies on its simplicity as efficient numerical-analytical schemes can be set up to compute the two-and three-body integrals occurring in the effective TC Hamiltonian. To obtain accurate ground state energies within a given basis set, the present TC scheme is coupled to the recently proposed TC-full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo method [Cohen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 061101 (2019)]. We report ground state total energies on the Li-Ne series, together with their first cations, computed with increasingly large basis sets and compare to more elaborate correlation factors involving electron-electron-nucleus coordinates. Numerical results on the Li-Ne ionization potentials show that the use of the single-parameter correlation factor brings on average only a slightly lower accuracy (1.2 mH) in a triple-zeta quality basis set with respect to a more sophisticated correlation factor. However, already using a quadruple-zeta quality basis set yields results within chemical accuracy to complete basis set limit results when using this novel single-parameter correlation factor. Calculations on the H2O, CH2, and FH molecules show that a similar precision can be obtained within a triple-zeta quality basis set for the atomization energies of molecular systems.},

However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and connectivity) hamper the implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. We propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach to target these major roadblocks directly. This method transfers, without any approximation, correlations from the wave function directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy quantum devices. We show that the TC approach allows for shallower circuits and improves the convergence toward the complete basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, thus, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using two and four qubits, respectively. To demonstrate our approach's current and near-term potential, we perform hardware experiments, where our results confirm that the TC method paves the way toward accurate quantum chemistry calculations already on today's quantum hardware.},

The resulting correlation factor exactly imposes the cusp and is tuned by a unique parameter {$\mu$}, which controls both the depth of the coulomb hole and its typical range in r12. The transcorrelated Hamiltonian obtained with such a new correlation factor has a straightforward analytical expression depending on the same parameter {$\mu$}, and its physical contents continuously change by varying {$\mu$}: One can change from a non-divergent repulsive Hamiltonian at large {$\mu$} to a purely attractive one at small {$\mu$}. We investigate the convergence of the ground state eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of such a new transcorrelated Hamiltonian as a function of the basis set and as a function of {$\mu$} on a series of two-electron systems. We found that the convergence toward the complete basis set is much faster for quite a wide range of values of {$\mu$}.

Here we develop a transcorrelated approach where the cusp is treated exactly and folded into the many-body Hamiltonian with a similarity transformation that removes the leading-order singularity. The resulting transcorrelated Hamiltonian is not Hermitian but can be treated numerically with a standard projection approach. The smoothness of the wave function improves by at least one order and thus the convergence rate for the ground-state energy improves. By numerical investigation of a one-dimensional gas of spin-12 fermions we find the error in the transcorrelated energy to scale as M-3 with a single-particle basis of M plane waves compared to M-1 for the expansion of the original Hamiltonian and M-2 using conventional lattice renormalization.},

  abstract = {Simulation of electronic structure is one of the most promising applications on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices. However, NISQ devices suffer from a number of challenges like limited qubit connectivity, short coherence times, and sizable gate error rates. Thus, desired quantum algorithms should require shallow circuit depths and low qubit counts to take advantage of these devices. Here, we attempt to reduce quantum resource requirements for molecular simulations on a quantum computer while maintaining the desired accuracy with the help of classical quantum chemical theories of canonical transformation and explicit correlation. In this work, compact ab initio Hamiltonians are generated classically, in the second quantized form, through an approximate similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with (a) an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator with generalized pair excitations that remove the Coulombic electron--electron singularities from the Hamiltonian and (b) a unitary one-body operator to efficiently capture the orbital relaxation effects required for accurate description of the excited states. The resulting transcorrelated Hamiltonians are able to describe both the ground and the excited states of molecular systems in a balanced manner. Using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz and only a minimal basis set (ANO-RCC-MB), we demonstrate that the transcorrelated Hamiltonians can produce ground state energies comparable to the reference CCSD energies with the much larger cc-pVTZ basis set. This leads to a reduction in the number of required CNOT gates by more than 3 orders of magnitude for the chemical species studied in this work. Furthermore, using the quantum equation of motion (qEOM) formalism in conjunction with the transcorrelated Hamiltonian, we are able to reduce the deviations in the excitation energies from the reference EOM-CCSD/cc-pVTZ values by an order of magnitude. The transcorrelated Hamiltonians developed here are Hermitian and contain only one- and two-body interaction terms and thus can be easily combined with any quantum algorithm for accurate electronic structure simulations.}

  abstract = {We present the theory of a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm which can solve for both the ground and excited states of non-Hermitian transcorrelated Hamiltonians and show applications in molecular systems. Transcorrelation (TC) accelerates the basis set convergence rate by including known physics (such as, but not limited to, the electron--electron cusp) in the Jastrow factor used for the similarity transformation. It also improves the accuracy of approximate methods such as coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) as shown by recent studies. However, the non-Hermiticity of the TC Hamiltonians poses challenges for variational methods like DMRG. Imaginary-time evolution on the matrix product state (MPS) in the DMRG framework has been proposed to circumvent this problem, but this is currently limited to treating the ground state and has lower efficiency than the time-independent DMRG (TI-DMRG) due to the need to eliminate Trotter errors. In this work, we show that with minimal changes to the existing TI-DMRG algorithm, namely, replacing the original Davidson solver with the general Davidson solver to solve the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians at each site for a few low-lying right eigenstates, and following the rest of the original DMRG recipe, one can find the ground and excited states with improved efficiency compared to the original DMRG when extrapolating to the infinite bond dimension limit in the same basis set. An accelerated basis set convergence rate is also observed, as expected, within the TC framework.}

One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans{\"a}tze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H4, LiH, and H2O. In particular, H4 is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans{\"a}tze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans{\"a}tze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.},

The transcorrelated Hamiltonian used in this work is efficiently constructed classically, at polynomial cost, by an approximate similarity transformation with an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator. This Hamiltonian is Hermitian, includes no more than two-particle interactions, and is free of electron--electron singularities. We investigate the effect of such a transformed Hamiltonian on the accuracy and computational cost of quantum simulations by focusing on a widely used solver for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, namely the variational quantum eigensolver method, based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (q-UCCSD) Ansatz. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here translates straightforwardly to other quantum algorithms for chemistry. Our results demonstrate that a transcorrelated Hamiltonian, paired with extremely compact bases, produces explicitly correlated energies comparable to those from much larger bases. For the chemical species studied here, explicitly correlated energies based on an underlying 6-31G basis had cc-pVTZ quality. The use of the very compact transcorrelated Hamiltonian reduces the number of CNOT gates required to achieve cc-pVTZ quality by up to two orders of magnitude, and the number of qubits by a factor of three.},

We find that a position of the deep valence bands is improved by an explicit inclusion of core states, but an overall band structure is consistent with a regular setup that includes core states into the pseudopotentials. This study offers an important understanding for the future application of the TC method to strongly correlated solids.},

Conventional CIS with the Hartree--Fock wave function, while a popular method for excited-state calculations of molecular systems, cannot describe electron correlation effects, such as the screening effect in solids, resulting in inaccurate results such as overestimation of the band gap and exciton binding energy. Here, we adopt the TC method, which takes electron correlations into account through a similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian using the Jastrow factor, and combine it with the CIS approximation. We calculate the optical absorption spectra of solid LiF and GaAs as a test, and verify that the present method reproduces the spectra more accurately than the conventional HF-CIS. The excitonic effect is well described with our method.}

In the TC method, a Jastrow--Slater-type correlated wavefunction is used as a trial function. Similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with respect to the Jastrow correlation function is utilized to derive Hartree--Fock (HF)-like self-consistent-field (SCF) equations, which determine the one-body wavefunctions in the Slater determinant and their orbital energies. Since the electron correlation is taken into account, the method could be a practical tool for band structure calculation of solids where the HF method fails even qualitatively. The single-particle energy dispersion of the electron gas shows no singularity at the Fermi surface due to the screening effect incorporated in the TC method. It is also demonstrated that this method significantly reduces the band gaps of Si, C, and SiC when compared with their corresponding Hartree--Fock values.},

In particular, Dobrautz et al. [Phys. Rev. B 99, 075119 (2019)] have demonstrated that the use of momentum-space representation, combined with a nonunitary similarity transformation, results in a Hubbard Hamiltonian that possesses a significantly more ``compact'' ground-state wave function, dominated by a single Slater determinant. This compactness/single-reference character greatly facilitates electronic structure calculations. As a consequence, however, the Hamiltonian becomes non-Hermitian, posing problems for quantum algorithms based on the variational principle. We overcome these limitations with the Ansatz-based quantum imaginary-time evolution algorithm and apply the transcorrelated method in the context of digital quantum computing. We demonstrate that this approach enables up to four orders of magnitude more accurate and compact solutions in various instances of the Hubbard model at intermediate interaction strength ({$U$}/{$t$}=4), enabling the use of shallower quantum circuits for wave-function Ans{\"a}tzes. In addition, we propose a more efficient implementation of the quantum imaginary-time evolution algorithm in quantum circuits that is tailored to non-Hermitian problems. To validate our approach, we perform hardware experiments on the ibmq\_lima quantum computer. Our work paves the way for the use of exact transcorrelated methods for the simulations of ab initio systems on quantum computers.},

Two parameters in the Jastrow factor are determined by the cusp conditions, which restricts the short-range electronic interactions and the long-range asymptotic condition resulted from the random-phase approximation. The energy is expressed within three-body integrals using the two-body Jastrow factor and so it is easily applied to the homogeneous electron gas without Monte Carlo sampling.
