  abstract = {The explicitly correlated approach is one of the most important breakthroughs in ab initio electronic structure theory, providing arguably the most compact, accurate, and efficient ansatz for describing the correlated motion of electrons. Since Hylleraas first used an explicitly correlated wave function for the He atom in 1929, numerous attempts have been made to tackle the significant challenges involved in constructing practical explicitly correlated methods that are applicable to larger systems. These include identifying suitable mathematical forms of a correlated wave function and an efficient evaluation of many-electron integrals. R12 theory, which employs the resolution of the identity approximation, emerged in 1985, followed by the introduction of novel correlation factors and wave function ansätze, leading to the establishment of F12 theory in the 2000s. Rapid progress in recent years has significantly extended the application range of explicitly correlated theory, offering the potential of an accurate wave-function treatment of complex systems such as photosystems and semiconductors. This perspective surveys explicitly correlated electronic structure theory, with an emphasis on recent stochastic and deterministic approaches that hold significant promise for applications to large and complex systems including solids.},

  abstract = {The calculation of the electronic structure of molecules solely from first principles is a subject of intensive research programs worldwide. The goal of these efforts is to develop efficient computational methods for determining molecular properties. Such methods are based on quantum mechanical many-body methods, which allow for a correct description of the complex correlated motion of electrons. However, despite the immense advances in the computational capabilities during the last decades, highly accurate calculations are still limited to molecules containing no more than ten to twenty atoms. In this context, one of the most severe problems is that the intrinsic accuracy of the employed many-body methods is generally hard to reach in practical calculations. This is a side effect of the expansion of molecular wave functions in terms of a finite basis of one-particle functions ("molecular orbitals"): A large number of basis functions per atom is required for accurately describing the microstructure of the wave function which is caused by the divergent Coulomb interaction. Calculations become very expensive very quickly. Explicitly correlated methods offer a promising approach to circumvent this problem of basis set convergence. Basically, such methods are variants of the common many-body methods of quantum mechanics (e.g., perturbation theory or Coupled Cluster methods) in which the common wave function ansatz is extended by additional terms which contain the inter-electronic distance explicitly. Methods of this form with a potential for routine applications were first proposed by Kutzelnigg and Klopper in 1991. During the last years the explicitly correlated methods were developed to such a degree that they now can clearly surpass the accuracy-to-cost ratio of their conventional counterparts. Such explicitly correlated methods were developed as a part of this dissertation. Concretely, open-shell variants of Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and of Coupled Cluster Singles \& Doubles were produced. Apart from that, also theoretical aspects are discussed, like the interpretation of F12 wave functions or special issues arising when handling open-shell species. Also technical aspects are considered, like the robust solution of the occurring equation systems and the avoidance of numerical problems. Furthermore, methods are developed to correct for Hartree-Fock basis set deviations in the context of explicitly correlated calculations, and simple approximations are investigated which accelerate the basis set convergence of perturbative triple excitations in Coupled Cluster calculations. Extensive benchmark calculations are essential for facilitating the practical application of new calculation methods. This applies particularly if the new methods are supposed to have a "black box" character, like it is the case here. As a consequence, a great part of this work is concerned with performing and evaluating calculations, in order to establish the accuracy of the developed methods and in order to derive optimal default calculation parameters. In this regard, different families of atomic orbital basis sets are investigated for their compatibility with F12 calculations, and the effect of the free length scale parameter of the theory is quantified. In pursuance of a wide range of application scenarios, the new methods are tested on a great variety of different calculation tasks. A special emphasis is placed on difficult problems, like the calculation of atomization energies, of electron affinities and ionization potentials, and of potential energy curves of diatomic molecules and of atomic dipole polarizabilities. The quantum chemical methods developed here can reduce the computational cost of highly accurate calculations by more than two order of magnitude since, due to their fast basis set convergence, less basis functions are required to achieve a desired accuracy. Therefore this work significantly extends the range of molecules for which such highly accurate calculations are possible.},

For excited states, we looked at vertical excitation energies, UV absorption, and excited-state absorption spectra. Convergence is compared against the basis sets cc-pVnZ, def2-nVD, aug-pcseg-n, and nZaPa-NR. It is established that the cc-pVnZ-F12 family consistently yields results of n + 1 quality and better.

The energy increments E l (2) corresponding to the partial wave expansion of χ go asymptotically as l−8, while conventional partial wave increments go as l−4. χ is coupled to Φ by a “residual” interaction U12 that has no singularity for r12=0. With the present ansatz it is sufficient to include l-values up to 5 in order to get the second-order energy accurate to one microhartree. For the same accuracy l≤4 is sufficient in a “CI with correlated reference function” while in conventional CI one must go to l∼50. The surprisingly faster convergence of the variational approach as compared to second-order perturbation theory is explained. The slow convergence of the traditional partial wave expansion is entirely due to the attempt to represent the quantity 1=〈Φ¦r12r12 −1¦Φ〉 by its partial wave expansion. The best reference function Φ shows very little shielding and resembles closely the eigenstate of the bare nuclear Hamiltonian. The generalization to arbitrary systems is discussed and it is pointed out that the calculation of “difficult” integrals can be avoided without a significant loss in accuracy.},

  abstract = {k-particle cumulants λk (for 2⩽k⩽n) corresponding to the k-particle reduced density matrices γk for an n-fermion system are defined via a generating function. The two-particle cumulant λ2 describes two-particle correlations (excluding exchange), λ3 genuine three-particle correlations etc. The properties of these cumulants are analyzed. Conditions for vanishing of certain λk are formulated. Necessary and sufficient for λ2=0 is the well-known idempotency condition γ2=γ for γ≡γ1. For λ3=0 to hold, a general necessary condition is Tr\{2γ3−3γ2+γ\}=0, for three special forms of the wave function (arbitrary two-electron state, antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals on antisymmetrized geminal power wave function of extreme type) 2γ3−3γ2+γ=0 turns out to be necessary and sufficient. For a multiconfiguration self-consistent field wave function the only nonvanishing matrix elements of the cumulants are those where all labels refer to active (partially occupied) spin orbitals. Spin-free cumulants Λk corresponding to the spin-free reduced density matrices Γk are also defined and analyzed. The main interest in the density cumulants is in connection with the recently formulated normal ordering and the corresponding Wick theorem for arbitrary reference functions, but they are also useful for an analysis of electron correlation.},

  abstract = {A generalization of normal ordering and of Wick’s theorem with respect to an arbitrary reference function Φ as some generalized “physical vacuum” is formulated in a different (but essentially equivalent) way than that suggested previously by one of the present authors. Guiding principles are that normal order operators with respect to any reference state must be expressible as linear combinations of those with respect to the genuine vacuum, that the vacuum expectation value of a normal order operator must vanish (with respect to the vacuum to which it is in normal order), and that the well-known formalism for a single Slater determinant as physical vacuum must be contained as a special case. The derivation is largely based on the concepts of “Quantum Chemistry in Fock space,” which means that particle-number-conserving operators (excitation operators) play a central role. Nevertheless, the contraction rules in the frame of a generalized Wick theorem are derived, that hold for non-particle-number-conserving operators as well. The contraction rules are formulated and illustrated in terms of diagrams. The contractions involve the “residual n-particle density matrices” λ, which are the irreducible (non-factorizable) parts of the conventional n-particle density matrices γ, in the sense of a cumulant expansion for the density. A spinfree formulation is presented as well. The expression of the Hamiltonian in normal order with respect to a multiconfiguration reference function leads to a natural definition of a generalized Fock operator. MC-SCF-theory is easily worked out in this context. The paper concludes with a discussion of the excited configurations and the first-order interacting space, that underlies a perturbative coupled cluster type correction to the MCSCF function for an arbitrary reference function, and with general implications of the new formalism, that is related to “internally contracted multireference configuration interaction.” The present generalization of normal ordering is not only valid for arbitrary reference functions, but also if the reference state is an ensemble state.},
