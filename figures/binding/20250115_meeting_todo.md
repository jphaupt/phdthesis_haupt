TODO list from 20250115 meeting

- [ ] trial wave function xTC-FCIQMC
- [ ] use pruning script along the curve to remove incomplete sets
- [ ] introduce epsilon parameters in ci_to_corr.py for n-highest option
- [ ] N2 binding curves for other basis sets
- [ ] time-averaged CI vector(?)
- [ ] replica-averaged CI vector -> might be bad if we have degenerate values?
- [ ] make sure to hammer down FCIQMC non-TC
- [ ] excited states N2
- [ ] excited states ammonia
- [ ] excited states: find one exceptionally bad molecules for Loos
- [ ] excited states: active-space-only (might not include if the results are not nice)

No DCSD
