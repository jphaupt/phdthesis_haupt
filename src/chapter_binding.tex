\section{Introduction}

\todo{problem description, including the ``dip''}

\section{Size Consistency}

\subsection{Jastrow Factor Forms}

\section{CASSCF Ansatz}
\todo{present the bad data :( -- mention might hint at needing the core (I think Andreea's paper corroborated this)}

\section{Transcorrelated Trial Wavefunction}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Binding Curves}
\todo{mention that we fix the binding curves}
\todo{also include a table about just ``how size-consistent'' the results actually are.}

\subsection{Excitation Energies}
\todo{mention can target the exact state(s) in question}

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\todo{make sure to mention the cutoff analysis and constructing Jastrow factors from atomic Jastrow factors}
