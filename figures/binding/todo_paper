For the paper:
- [ ] hammer down trial wave function xTC-FCIQMC calculations
- [ ] time-averaged CI vector?
- [ ] replica-averaged CI vector (maybe not a good idea if we have degenerate eigenvectors?)
- [ ] really hammer down FCIQMC non-TC
- [ ] one other molecule's excited states
- [ ] basis sets: avdz, avtz, avqz
