  abstract = {The wavefunctions for neon and its positive ion which are reported here appear to be more accurate than any which have previously been available. This is because full correlation for all pairs of electrons h as been evaluated by the particular transcorrelated matrix equations recently derived for wavefunctions with explicit electronic correlation. The error in the predicted ionization potential of neon obtained by the difference of the energies of the two calculations is about 1 kcal/mole, which can be regarded as reasonable chemical accuracy. The errors in the total correlation energies are about 6\% . It is considered that this method of calculation shows greater possibilities for the accurate prediction of the energies of atomic and molecular systems than those previously available.},

  abstract = {We introduce in quantum mechanics a concept of \textbackslash textit\{rigidity\} and a concept of a \textbackslash textit\{pinned point\} of a wave function. The concept of a pinned point is a generalization of a familiar concept in the description of a vibrating string, while the concept of rigidity is introduced to describe the sensitivity of a wave function to changes in energy, potential, and/or external perturbation. Through these concepts and their mathematical implications, we introduce and formulate cusp conditions and cusp functions as fundamental properties of an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system with \$N\textbackslash ge 2\$, greatly expanding their relevance beyond the Coulombic systems. The theory provides rigorous constraints on an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system, specifically on its short-range pair correlation that is essential to a better understanding of strongly correlated systems. More broadly, the theory and the derivations presented here are part of a reconstruction of the mathematical and conceptual foundation of an \$N\$-body quantum theory, incorporating previously hidden properties and insights revealed through the concepts of rigidity and pinned points. It includes general analytic properties of a 2-body wave function versus energy and their relations to cusp conditions and cusp functions. It includes a rigorous derivation and an understanding, in terms of an emergent length scale, of the 2-particle separability in an \$(N{$>$}2)\$-body quantum system and its relations to cusp conditions. It also includes a classification of quantum systems, both 2-body and \$N\$-body, based on the universal behaviors in their short-range correlation.},

We named them general coalescence conditions (GCCs). The GCCs can be applied not only to Coulombic systems. In this article, we review the GCCs for two- and many-particle systems. Then, we numerically verify that the GCC equations are satisfied by the free complement (FC) wave function of a hydrogen atom in the 1s and 2p states, a harmonic oscillator, V=r system, and a helium atom. Based on the GCCs, a new method is proposed to determine parameters in a trial wave function. We named them GCC constrained (GCCC) method. Using the GCCC method combined with the FC wave function, we could obtain the exact wave function that behaves correctly in the coalescence point.},

  abstract = {The Schrödinger equation was solved very accurately for helium atom and its isoelectronic ions (Z=1–10) with the free iterative complement interaction (ICI) method followed by the variational principle. We obtained highly accurate wave functions and energies of helium atom and its isoelectronic ions. For helium, the calculated energy was −2.90372437703411959831115924519440444669690537a.u., correct over 40 digit accuracy, and for H−, it was −0.52775101654437719659081456674751138304502a.u. These results prove numerically that with the free ICI method, we can calculate the solutions of the Schrödinger equation as accurately as one desires. We examined several types of scaling function g and initial function ψ0 of the free ICI method. The performance was good when logarithm functions were used in the initial function because the logarithm function is physically essential for three-particle collision area. The best performance was obtained when we introduce a new logarithm function containing not only r1 and r2 but also r12 in the same logarithm function.},
