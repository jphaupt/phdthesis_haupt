The authors discuss the latest simulation techniques of molecular dynamics and the Monte Carlo methods as well as how to avoid common programming pitfalls. Theoretical concepts and practical programming advice are amply reinforced with examples of computer simulation in action and samples of Fortran code. The authors have also included a wide selection of programs and routines on microfiche to aid chemists, physicists, chemical engineers, and computer scientists, as well as graduate and advanced students in chemistry.},

The change of drift is selected adaptatively through the Monte Carlo computation by using a suitable sequence of approximation.

We develop two applications of the procedure for variance reduction in a Monte Carlo computation in finance and in reliability.},

The scheme is highly efficient and allows us to investigate the parameter space more closely than has been possible before.

These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters. CONTENTS},

Since the use of high-speed computers became widespread in the 1950s, a great deal of theoretical investigation has been undertaken and practical experience has been gained in the Monte Carlo approach. The author tries to lay a theoretical basis for both the 'traditional' Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods, and, to present some practical aspects of when and how to use them. An important theme is the comparison of Monte Carlo, quasi-Monte Carlo and numerical quadrature for the integration of functions, especially in many dimensions.},
