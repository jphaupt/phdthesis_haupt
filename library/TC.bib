  abstract = {Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. In addition, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing us to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present an extension of popular selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms to the Transcorrelated (TC) framework. Although we used in this work the recently introduced one-parameter correlation factor [E. Giner, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 084119 (2021)], the theory presented here is valid for any correlation factor. Thanks to the formalization of the non-Hermitian TC eigenvalue problem as a search of stationary points for a specific functional depending on both left- and right-functions, we obtain a general framework, allowing for different choices for both the selection criterion in SCI and the second order perturbative correction to the energy. After numerical investigations on different second-row atomic and molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets, we found that taking into account the non-Hermitian character of the TC Hamiltonian in the selection criterion is mandatory to obtain a fast convergence of the TC energy. In addition, selection criteria based on either the first order coefficient or the second order energy lead to significantly different convergence rates, which is typically not the case in the usual Hermitian SCI. Regarding the convergence of the total second order perturbation energy, we find that the quality of the left-function used in the equations strongly affects the quality of the results. Within the near-optimal algorithm proposed here, we find that the SCI expansion in the TC framework converges faster than the usual SCI in terms of both the basis set and the number of Slater determinants.},

We demonstrate the efficiency of tcDMRG with the example of the two-dimensional Fermi--Hubbard Hamiltonian, a notoriously difficult target for the DMRG algorithm, for different sizes, occupation numbers, and interaction strengths.

Here such a contraction condition is proposed in a form which only involves six-dimensional integrals and which has been found to give a very systematic procedure in a thorough calculation of a correlated wavefunction for neon. Certain correlation expansion functions can be defined so that any combination of these gives a function which satisfies this contraction condition. This contracted form provides canonical expressions for the correlation function and the orbitals so that if two different calculations are made in this form it is possible to compare the two correlation functions and the two sets of orbitals because in the completely accurate wavefunction they should be the same. Such a property has not occurred in previous calculations or theories.},

Even these nine-dimensional integrals have some special characteristics which make them equivalent to six-dimensional integrals in some methods of integration. The method is formulated for the particular canonical choice of correlation function that has been previously investigated by the authors and is based on a particular trans-correlated kind of wave equation and on some particular convergence properties recently shown for bi-variational problems.

The results are in accord with the high accuracy found for the Ne atom by Handy \& Boys (1968c). The spherical symmetry of the Ne problem gave such advantages that the integrals could virtually be evaluated exactly. The new problem of evaluating these integrals for functions about the many nuclei has now been overcome by a particular numerical integration procedure which gives a much higher accuracy in the energy than corresponds to the accuracy of integration for an ordinary integral. Hence a set of points which is much more restricted in number than otherwise can be used. The error per electron is nearly as small as 1 \% of a bond energy, and it is reasonable to expect that later applications of this method will easily surpass this accuracy for a wide range of molecules, and for reacting systems. The method depends on the direct introduction of functions of rij into the correlation factor in a way applicable to any molecule and the successful implementation of this for the first molecule may provide a turning point in methods of theoretical chemical prediction. The preparation of the whole set of programs requires less than one man year and the general characteristics are those of a method which is much simpler than the previous methods which do not appear capable of this level of accuracy.},

We apply this methodology to study the two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions near half filling in the intermediate interaction strength regime ({$U$}/{$t$}=4). We show that at optimal or near optimal strength of the Gutzwiller correlator, the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian has extremely compact right eigenvectors, which can be sampled to high accuracy using the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method and its initiator approximation. Near-optimal correlators can be obtained using a simple projective equation, thus obviating the need for a numerical optimization of the correlator. The FCIQMC method, as a projective technique, is well suited for such non-Hermitian problems, and its stochastic nature can handle the three-body interactions exactly without undue increase in computational cost. The highly compact nature of the right eigenvectors means that the initiator approximation in FCIQMC is not severe and that large lattices can be simulated, well beyond the reach of the method applied to the original Hubbard Hamiltonian. Results are provided in lattice sizes up to 50 sites and compared to auxiliary-field QMC. New benchmark results are provided in the off-half-filling regime, with no severe sign problem being encountered. In addition, we show that methodology can be used to calculate excited states of the Hubbard model and lay the groundwork for the calculation of observables other than the energy.},

Through these concepts and their mathematical implications, we introduce and formulate cusp conditions and cusp functions as fundamental properties of an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system with \$N{\textbackslash}ge 2\$, greatly expanding their relevance beyond the Coulombic systems. The theory provides rigorous constraints on an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system, specifically on its short-range pair correlation that is essential to a better understanding of strongly correlated systems. More broadly, the theory and the derivations presented here are part of a reconstruction of the mathematical and conceptual foundation of an \$N\$-body quantum theory, incorporating previously hidden properties and insights revealed through the concepts of rigidity and pinned points. It includes general analytic properties of a 2-body wave function versus energy and their relations to cusp conditions and cusp functions. It includes a rigorous derivation and an understanding, in terms of an emergent length scale, of the 2-particle separability in an \$(N{$>$}2)\$-body quantum system and its relations to cusp conditions.

  abstract = {We investigate the optimization of flexible tailored real-space Jastrow factors for use in the transcorrelated (TC) method in combination with highly accurate quantum chemistry methods, such as initiator full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC). Jastrow factors obtained by minimizing the variance of the TC reference energy are found to yield better, more consistent results than those obtained by minimizing the variational energy. We compute all-electron atomization energies for the challenging first-row molecules C2, CN, N2, and O2 and find that the TC method yields chemically accurate results using only the cc-pVTZ basis set, roughly matching the accuracy of non-TC calculations with the much larger cc-pV5Z basis set. We also investigate an approximation in which pure three-body excitations are neglected from the TC-FCIQMC dynamics, saving storage and computational costs, and show that it affects relative energies negligibly.

Two different reference functions are employed in the calculations and the results are compared with those of the conventional LCC. The application to the water molecule shows a markedly better convergence of the correlation energies when the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is used than in the conventional approach. We also present results for some other ten-electron systems, Ne, HF, NH3, and CH4.}

The method consists of setting up a wave function as a series in the five variables required, electronic separation being introduced explicitly as one of the variables. The coefficients are then determined so as to produce the lowest energy. The energy found is within 0.03 v.e. of the most probable experimental value, while the form and location of the potential energy curve for various internuclear distances agree with those deduced from spectra to within similar limits. The value of the function is computed for several configurations of the electrons, and compared with other approximations. Application of the method to other problems is discussed. A method is given for the numerical solution of secular equations of high degree.},

The computations have been made with 54-term expansions (0.4{$\leq$}R{$\leq$}3.7) and with 80-term expansions (0.5{$\leq$}R{$\leq$}2.0). For the equilibrium internuclear distance, the best total energies obtained in the two cases are ---1.1744701 a.u. and ---1.1744746 a.u., respectively, the corresponding binding energies being 38 291.8 and 38 292.7 cm---1. Employing the 54-term wavefunctions, the relativistic corrections and the diagonal corrections for nuclear motion have been computed for several internuclear distances. For equilibrium their contributions to the binding energy have been found to be ---0.526 and 4.947 cm---1, respectively. Thus the final theoretical binding energy for H2 amounts to 38 297.1 cm---1 and is a little larger than the experimental value 38 292.9{\textpm}0.5 cm---1. The discrepancy may be due to the adiabatic approximation.},

  abstract = {In the Hylleraas-CI method, first proposed by Sims and Hagstrom, correlation factors of the type r are included into the configurations of a CI expansion. The computation of the matrix elements requires the evaluation of different two-, three-, and four-electron integrals. In this article we present formulas for the two-electron integrals over Cartesian Gaussian functions, the most used basis functions in molecular calculations. Most of the integrals have been calculated analytically in closed form (some of them in terms of the incomplete Gamma function), but in one case a numerical integration is required, although the interval for the integration is finite and the integrand well-behaved. We have also reported on partial and preliminary computations for the H2 molecule using our four-center general formulas; a basis set of s- and p-type functions yielded at R = 1.4001 {\AA} an energy of - 1.174380 a.u. to be compared with Kolos and Wolniewicz value of - 1.174475.},

The single-particle energy dispersion of the electron gas shows no singularity at the Fermi surface due to the screening effect incorporated in the TC method.

The method previously applied by the writer to the helium problem appears as a next approximation, in which the outer electron moves, not in a hydrogen-like field, but in a somewhat more accurate central field. It is shown that this method should give a good approximation to the energy levels, and also to the wave function, except at very small distances. The attempt to use this function as a starting point for perturbation calculations is shown, however, not to be justified, for the matrix of the Hamiltonian function {$H$}, which is used in the perturbation method, greatly magnifies the errors in the wave function. Suggestions are made as to the next step in improving the method, by increasing the accuracy of the wave function for small {$r\prime$}s.},

  abstract = {Second-order correlation energies for He, Be, H2 and LiH were calculated variationally using a novel functional and a basis set of explicitly correlated Gaussian geminals. Each geminal was a product of two spherical Gaussian orbitals and a correlation factor of the form exp(-{$\gamma$}r212). Since the time-consuming terms resulting from the strong orthogonality do not appear in our functional, basis sets much larger than previous ones could be handled. The second-order energies obtained after carefully optimizing all nonlinear parameters are better than the best values published hitherto in the literature, although the improvement is marginal for He and Be. This shows that the present approach is able to match the ``basis set independent'' results available for atoms, providing at the same time a similar accuracy for small molecules. The proposed approach offers a sensible alternative to the virtual orbital expansion method customarily used in MBPT calculations, since, for obtaining a comparable accuracy, orbitals much higher than f would have to be used in expanding the pair functions.},

Multi-configurational models are therefore essential to establish universally applicable, predictive ab initio methods for chemistry. Here, we present a discussion of explicit correlation approaches which address the nagging problem of dealing with static and dynamic electron correlation in multi-configurational approaches. We review the latest developments and then point to their key obstacles. Our discussion is supported by new data obtained with tensor network methods. We argue in favor of simple electrons-only correlator expressions that may allow one to define transcorrelated models, in which the correlator does not bear a dependence on molecular structure.},

The effective Hamiltonian is parameterized in such a way that the Coulomb repulsion is compensated at short inter-electronic distances in terms of a frozen Gaussian geminal. The geminal is chosen to be independent of the position and orientation of pair-electrons. The extra part of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is also short-ranged, size-consistent, and universal to the states of interest. We preliminarily applied the method to the single-reference many body perturbation theory with some pilot calculations.}

  abstract = {A Jastrow--Slater-type wave function is often used as a trial function for precise calculations of the total energy of electronic systems, where the correlation effect is taken into account by the Jastrow factor that directly depends on the distance between electrons. Since many-body integrals are inevitable there, the calculation totally depends on Monte Carlo sampling, and so, except for very simple cases, it is very difficult to optimize one-body wave functions in the Slater determinant which determine the nodal surfaces of the total wave function. Here we propose and demonstrate that the total wave function is efficiently optimized by coupling an ordinary variational Monte Carlo (VMC) technique with the transcorrelated method, in which the one-body wave functions are definitely obtained by solving Hartree--Fock-type self-consistent-field (SCF) equations derived from the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. It is shown that the present method reproduces about 90\% of the correlation energy for helium-like two-electron systems (H-, He, Li+, and Be2+) and gives much better results than the conventional VMC method using the Hartree--Fock orbitals for a Li atom, a Be atom, and a H2 molecule. It is also shown that the orbital energy appearing in the SCF equations gives a good approximation to the ionization potential.},
