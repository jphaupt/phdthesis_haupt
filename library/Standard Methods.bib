  abstract = {The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (icMRCC) theory is reexamined in a multistate framework. The new derivation starts from the Bloch equations employing a wave operator similar to the one originally employed by Jeziorski and Monkhorst [Phys. Rev. A 24, 1668 (1981)], but allows for a multideterminantal model-space basis. The resulting working equations are a generalization of state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SU-MRCC) theory. In the case of truncated cluster operators, energies and wave functions depend on the choice of the model-space basis. It is shown that the state-specific solutions of the original icMRCC theory exactly diagonalize the effective Hamiltonian of the multistate theory and thus decouple the multistate equations. While this in principle means that icMRCC is a multistate theory, we find that truncated icMRCC theory still shows minor artifacts close to avoided crossings, which can be removed by considering a true multistate ansatz. The results also shed new light on the orbital variance of the original SU-MRCC theory.},

  abstract = {We present an embedded fragment approach for high-level quantum chemical calculations on local features in periodic systems. The fragment is defined as a set of localized orbitals (occupied and virtual) corresponding to a converged periodic Hartree–Fock solution. These orbitals serve as the basis for the in-fragment post-Hartree–Fock treatment. The embedding field for the fragment, consisting of the Coulomb and exchange potential from the rest of the crystal, is included in the fragment’s one-electron Hamiltonian. As an application of the embedded fragment approach, we investigate the performance of full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) with the adaptive shift. As the orbital choice, we use the natural orbitals from the distinguishable cluster method with singles and doubles. FCIQMC is a stochastic approximation to the full CI method and can be routinely applied to much larger active spaces than the latter. This makes this method especially attractive in the context of open shell defects in crystals, where fragments of adequate size can be rather large. As a test case, we consider dissociation of a fluorine atom from a fluorographane surface. This process poses a challenge for high-level electronic structure models as both the static and dynamic correlations are essential here. Furthermore, the active space for an adequate fragment (32 electrons in 173 orbitals) is already quite large even for FCIQMC. Despite this, FCIQMC delivers accurate dissociation and total energies.},

  abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation\hphantom{,}consistent\hphantom{,}basis\hphantom{,}sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

A new semi-empirical method is proposed, therefore, in terms of equivalent orbitals. The equations obtained, which do have the usual form, are applicable to a large class of molecules and do not involve the approximations that were thought necessary. In this method the ionization potentials are calculated by treating certain integrals as semi-empirical parameters. The value of these parameters is discussed in terms of the localization of equivalent orbitals and some approximate rules are suggested. As an illustration the ionization potentials of the paraffin series are considered and good agreement between the observed and calculated values is found.},

  abstract = {The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (icMRCC) method allows a highly accurate description of both static and dynamic correlation with a computational scaling similar to single reference coupled cluster theory. The authors show that the method can lose its orbital invariance and size consistency when no special care is taken in the elimination of redundant excitations. Using the BeH2 model system, four schemes are compared which differ in their treatment of linear dependencies between excitations of different rank (such as between singles and doubles). While the energy curves agree within tens of μEh when truncating the cluster operator at double excitations (icMRCCSD), inclusion of triple excitations (icMRCCSDT) leads to significant differences of more than 1 mEh. One scheme clearly yields the best results, while the others even turn out to be not size consistent. The former procedure uses genuine single and double excitations and discards those linear combinations of (spectator) double and triple excitations which have the same effect on the reference function. With this approach, the equilibrium structure and harmonic vibrational frequencies of ozone obtained with icMRCCSDT are in excellent agreement with CCSDTQ. The authors further apply icMRCC methods to potential energy surfaces of HF, LiF, N2, and to the singlet-triplet splitting of benzynes. In particular, the latter calculations have been made possible by implementing the method with the proper formal scaling using automated techniques.},

  abstract = {The methods of solution of the wave equation for a central field given in the previous paper are applied to various atoms. For the core electrons, the details of the interaction of the electrons in a single nk group are neglected, but an approximate correction is made for the fact that the distributed charge of an electron does not contribute to the field acting on itself (§2).For a given atom the object of the work is to find a field such that the solutions of the wave equation for the core electrons in this field (corrected as just mentioned for each core electron) give a distribution of charge which reproduces the field. This is called the self-consistent field, and the process of finding it is one of successive approximation (§ 3).Approximations to the self-consistent field have been found for He (§ 4), Rb+ (§ 5), Na+, Cl− (§ 9). For He the energy parameter for the solution of the wave equation for one electron in the self-consistent field of the nucleus and the other corresponds to an ionisation potential of 24·85 volts (observed 24·6 volts); this agreement suggests that for other atoms the values of the energy parameter in the self-consistent field (corrected for each core electron) will probably give good approximations to the X-ray terms (§4).The most extensive work has been carried out for Rb+. The distribution of charge given by the wave functions in the self-consistent field is compared with the distribution calculated by other methods (§ 6). The values of X-ray and optical terms calculated from the self-consistent field show satisfactory agreement with those observed (§ 7).The wave mechanical analogue of the case in which on the orbital model an internal and an external orbit of the same energy are possible is discussed (§ 8).},

The latter is approximated by its one‐ and two‐electron components. Various aspects of the applicability of this version of the VU‐CC theory to quasidegenerate electronic states are studied for a model system consisting of two slightly stretched, interacting hydrogen molecules. A single parameter that determines the geometry of this system makes it possible to vary the extent of quasidegeneracy of the two lowest‐energy states over a wide range. Along with the complete theory, the linear version (VU‐LCC) is also examined. The results are compared with the full configuration interaction results as well as with those obtained using other approaches. It was found that, at least in the strongly quasidegenerate region, the VU‐CC energies are less accurate than those obtained with other multireference CC theories. It is shown that the VU‐CC equations for cluster amplitudes possess multiple solutions representing various pairs of states. The individual solutions that arise for a system possessing n‐valence electrons may be characterized in terms of a genealogical scheme that involves states of systems with 0,1,...,n valence electrons.},

  abstract = {An explicitly correlated version of the distinguishable-cluster approximation is presented and extensively benchmarked. It is shown that the usual F12-type explicitly correlated approaches are applicable to distinguishable-cluster theory with single and double excitations, and the results show a significant improvement compared to coupled-cluster theory with singles and doubles for closed and open-shell systems. The resulting method can be applied in a black-box manner to systems with single- and multireference character. Most noticeably, optimized geometries are of coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples quality or even better.},

These include a simpler and size extensive way to generate the excitation manifold and therefore determine the cluster amplitudes. Modifications and approximations are also introduced to the perturbative triples correction, icMRCCSD(T), which lead to a small improvement over the previous manifestation, at a reduced computational cost.

  abstract = {The chapter discusses the time-independent diagrammatic approach to perturbation theory of fermion systems. The chapter explores the perturbation theory for a non-degenerate level. The formulas derived serves as a starting point for the subsequent consideration of the excitation and ionization energies. The advantages of the direct calculation of excitation energies, compared with the approach in which the total energies of the pertinent electronic states are calculated separately for each state and then the excitation energies are obtained by subtracting the appropriate state energies, are quite obvious. The Rayleigh-Schrödinger (RS) perturbation theory (PT) for the case of a non-degenerate level of some Hamiltonian operator is discussed. The chapter discusses that even the Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation expressions for the direct calculation of the excitation energies may be obtained in a rather simple way without the involvement of the Green function formalism. On the contrary, our simple approach using the ordinary perturbation theory for separate levels presents certain desirable features of the Green function formalism. The chapter explains the diagrammatic representation of Wick's theorem and resulting diagrams. General explicit formulas for the second- and third-order excitation energy contributions are given in the chapter.},

  abstract = {Using systematic sequences of correlation consistent Gaussian basis sets from double to sextuple zeta quality, the classical barrier height of the H+H2 exchange reaction has been calculated by multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods. The MRCI calculations for collinear H3 have also been calibrated against large basis set full CI (FCI) results, which demonstrate that the MRCI treatment leads to energies less than 1 μhartree (≤0.001 kcal/mol) above the FCI energies. The dependence of both the H2 and H3 total energies on the basis set is found to be very regular, and this behavior has been used to extrapolate to the complete basis set (CBS) limits. The resulting estimate of the H–H–H CBS limit yields a classical barrier height, relative to exact H+H2, of 9.60±0.02 kcal/mol; the best directly calculated value for the barrier is equal to 9.62 kcal/mol. These results are in excellent agreement with recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations.},

  abstract = {In this work, the extension of the previously developed domain based local pair-natural orbital (DLPNO) based singles- and doubles coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD) method to perturbatively include connected triple excitations is reported. The development is based on the concept of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair natural orbital (PNO) spaces of the three electron pairs that are involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution. The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size O(N). Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane chains. The accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) approximation relative to semicanonical CCSD(T0) is comparable to the previously developed DLPNO-CCSD method relative to canonical CCSD. Relative energies are predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal/mol for a challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules. The triples correction typically adds 30\%–50\% to the overall computation time. Thus, very large systems can be treated on the basis of the current implementation. In addition to the linear C150H302 (452 atoms, \&gt;8800 basis functions) we demonstrate the first CCSD(T) level calculation on an entire protein, Crambin with 644 atoms, and more than 6400 basis functions.},

Three such methods that have been recently proposed include 2CC, parameterized CCSD generalizations, and distinguishable cluster singles and doubles (DCSD) approach. In this paper, we lay the theoretical foundation needed to treat excited states via the equation of motion (EOM) approach using these ground state CC methods. As these ground state approximations to CCSD share its property of being exact for two-electron systems, so will their excited state extensions. These methods are tested for two complementary benchmark sets of excited states for a wide range of organic molecules with focus on singlet and triplet excited states of both valence and Rydberg nature. We also test these methods for doubly excited states, taking CH+ as an example to test their performance at equilibrium and stretched bond geometries. Finally, we assess if any of these methods perform consistently better than EOM CCSD.},

  abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1Σ+g, 3Σ+u and 3Πg) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) Å; ωe: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.},

  abstract = {A density matrix formulation is presented of the super-C I and Newton-Raphson methods in complete active space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. The CASSCF method is a special form of the MC-SCF method, where the C I wave function is assumed to be complete in a subset of the orbital space (the active space), leaving the remaining orbitals doubly occupied in all configurations. Explicit formulas are given for all matrix elements in the super-C I method and the first and second derivatives in the Newton-Raphson formulation. The similarities between the two methods are pointed out and the differences in the detailed formulations are discussed. Especially interesting is the fact, that while the second derivatives can be expressed in terms of first and second order density matrices, the matrix elements between the super-C I states involve also the third order density matrix in some cases.},

  abstract = {The complete active space (CAS) SCF method is presented in detail with special emphasis on computational aspects. The CASSCF wave function is formed from a complete distribution of a number of active electrons in a set of active orbitals, which in general constitute a subset of the total occupied space. In contrast to other MCSCF schemes, a CASSCF calculation involves no selection of individual configurations, and the wave function therefore typically consists of a large number of terms. The largest case treated here includes 10\,416 spin and space adapted configurations. To be able to treat such large CI expansions, a density‐matrix oriented formalism is used. The Newton–Raphson scheme is applied to calculate the orbital rotations, and the secular problem is solved with recent developments of CI techniques. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in calculations on the HNO molecule in ground and excited states, using a triple‐zeta basis and different sizes of the active space. With a reasonable choice of active space, the calculations converge in 6–10 iterations. This is true also for states which are not the lowest state of the symmetry in question. The equilibrium geometry for the ground state is RNO=1.215(1.212) Å, RNH =1.079(1.063) Å, ϑHNO=108.8(108.6)\,°, the experimental values given in parenthesis for comparison. The best estimates for the transition energies to the lowest 3A″ and 1A″ states are 0.67(0.85) eV and 1.52(1.63) eV, respectively. The results obtained indicate that the choice of active space may be crucial for the convergence properties of CASSCF calculations.},

  abstract = {The tailored approach is applied to the distinguishable cluster method together with a stochastic FCI solver (FCIQMC). It is demonstrated that the new method is more accurate than the corresponding tailored coupled cluster and the pure distinguishable cluster methods. An F12 correction for tailored methods and FCIQMC is introduced, which drastically improves the basis set convergence. A new black-box approach to define the active space using the natural orbitals from the distinguishable cluster is evaluated and found to be a convenient alternative to the usual CASSCF approach.},

  abstract = {The family of correlation consistent polarized valence basis sets (cc-pVXZ) has been extended to include sextuple zeta sets (cc-pV6Z) for the atoms boron through neon. Potential energy functions have been calculated with these sets for the electronic ground states of N2 and HF using a number of correlated wave functions: MP2, MP3, MP4, CCSD, CCSD(T) and CAS+1+2. Spectroscopic constants have been calculated for each level of theory and have been compared with experiment. Combining these results with those of prior studies, complete basis set limits have been estimated for Ee, De and re. It is found that the cc-pV6Z basis sets yield dissociation energies that are within 0.6–0.8 kcal mol−1 (N2) and 0.1 kcal mol−1 (HF) of the estimated CBS limits. Adding core-core and core-valence contributions to the CCSD(T) CBS limits yields De's that are within 0.1 kcal mol−1 of the experimental values.},

  abstract = {Correlation consistent and augmented correlation consistent basis sets have been determined for the second row atoms aluminum through argon. The methodology, originally developed for the first row atoms [T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 90, (1989)] is first applied to sulfur. The exponents for the polarization functions (dfgh) are systematically optimized for a correlated wave function (HF+1+2). The (sp) correlation functions are taken from the appropriate HF primitive sets; it is shown that these functions differ little from the optimum functions. Basis sets of double zeta [4s3p1d], triple zeta [5s4p2d1f], and quadruple zeta [6s5p3d2f1g] quality are defined. Each of these sets is then augmented with diffuse functions to better describe electron affinities and other molecular properties: s and p functions were obtained by optimization for the anion HF energy, while an additional polarization function for each symmetry present in the standard set was optimized for the anion HF+1+2 energy. The results for sulfur are then used to assist in determining double zeta, triple zeta, and quadruple zeta basis sets for the remainder of the second row of the p block.},

  abstract = {An accurate description of the electrical properties of atoms and molecules is critical for quantitative predictions of the nonlinear properties of molecules and of long‐range atomic and molecular interactions between both neutral and charged species. We report a systematic study of the basis sets required to obtain accurate correlated values for the static dipole (α1), quadrupole (α2), and octopole (α3) polarizabilities and the hyperpolarizability (γ) of the rare gas atoms He, Ne, and Ar. Several methods of correlation treatment were examined, including various orders of Moller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2, MP3, MP4), coupled‐cluster theory with and without perturbative treatment of triple excitations [CCSD, CCSD(T)], and singles and doubles configuration interaction (CISD). All of the basis sets considered here were constructed by adding even‐tempered sets of diffuse functions to the correlation consistent basis sets of Dunning and co‐workers. With multiply‐augmented sets we find that the electrical properties of the rare gas atoms converge smoothly to values that are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and/or previously computed results. As a further test of the basis sets presented here, the dipole polarizabilities of the F− and Cl− anions and of the HCl and N2 molecules are also reported.},
