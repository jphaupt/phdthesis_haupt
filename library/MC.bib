  abstract = {We investigate the use of different variational principles in quantum Monte Carlo, namely, energy and variance minimization, prompted by the interest in the robust and accurate estimation of electronic excited states. For two prototypical, challenging molecules, we readily reach the accuracy of the best available reference excitation energies using energy minimization in a state-specific or state-average fashion for states of different or equal symmetry, respectively. On the other hand, in variance minimization, where the use of suitable functionals is expected to target specific states regardless of the symmetry, we encounter severe problems for a variety of wave functions: as the variance converges, the energy drifts away from that of the selected state. This unexpected behavior is sometimes observed even when the target is the ground state and generally prevents the robust estimation of total and excitation energies. We analyze this problem using a very simple wave function and infer that the optimization finds little or no barrier to escape from a local minimum or local plateau, eventually converging to a lower-variance state instead of the target state. For the increasingly complex systems becoming in reach of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, variance minimization with current functionals appears to be an impractical route.},

These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters. CONTENTS},

  abstract = {The quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method is gaining interest as a complement to basis set ab initio methods in cases where high accuracy computation of atomic and molecular properties is desired. This volume focuses on recent advances in this area. QMC as used here refers to methods that directly solve the Schrödinger equation, for example, diffusion and Green's function Monte Carlo, as well as variational Monte Carlo. The latter is an approach to computing atomic and molecular properties by the Monte Carlo method that has fundamental similarities to basis set methods with the exception that the limitation to one-particle basis functions to facilitate integral evaluation is avoided. This feature makes possible the consideration of many-body wave functions containing explicitly interparticle distances — a capability common to all variants of QMC.},

This demonstrates the feasibility of calculating properties of solids with the quantum Monte Carlo method, since the statistical error for a supercell of 64 atoms is {$<$}0.02 eV/atom. The agreement with experiment, although good, is limited by the accuracy of the pseudo-Hamiltonian. We find that the correlation energy is improved over a variational pair-product trial function by 0.34 eV/atom in the solid compared with 0.21 eV in the free atom.},
