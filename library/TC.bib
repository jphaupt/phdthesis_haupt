  abstract = {Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. In addition, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing us to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for a selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithm within a bi-orthogonal basis for transcorrelated (TC) calculations. The bi-orthogonal basis used here serves as the equivalent of the standard Hartree--Fock (HF) orbitals. However, within the context of TC, it leads to distinct orbitals for the left and right vectors. Our findings indicate that the use of such a bi-orthogonal basis allows for a proper definition of the frozen core approximation. In contrast, the use of HF orbitals results in bad error cancellations for ionization potentials and atomization energies (AE). Compared to HF orbitals, the optimized bi-orthogonal basis significantly reduces the positive part of the second-order energy (PT2), thereby facilitating the use of standard extrapolation techniques of hermitian SCI. While we did not observe a significant improvement in the convergence of the SCI algorithm, this is largely due to the use in this work of a simple three-body correlation factor introduced in a recent study. This correlation factor, which depends only on atomic parameters, eliminates the need for re-optimization of the correlation factor for molecular systems, making its use straightforward and user-friendly. Despite the simplicity of this correlation factor, we were able to achieve accurate results on the AE of a series of 14 molecules on a triple-zeta basis. We also successfully broke a double bond until the full dissociation limit while maintaining the size consistency property. This work thus demonstrates the potential of the BiO-TC-SCI approach in handling complex molecular systems.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present the first implementation of the transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonian in an optimization procedure for matrix product states by the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. In the transcorrelation ansatz, the electronic Hamiltonian is similarity-transformed with a Jastrow factor to describe the cusp in the wave function at electron--electron coalescence. As a result, the wave function is easier to approximate accurately with the conventional expansion in terms of one-particle basis functions and Slater determinants. The transcorrelated Hamiltonian in first quantization comprises up to three-body interactions, which we deal with in the standard way by applying robust density fitting to two- and three-body integrals entering the second-quantized representation of this Hamiltonian. The lack of hermiticity of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is taken care of along the lines of the first work on transcorrelated DMRG [ J. Chem. Phys. 2020, 153, 164115] by encoding it as a matrix product operator and optimizing the corresponding ground state wave function with imaginary-time time-dependent DMRG. We demonstrate our quantum chemical transcorrelated DMRG approach at the example of several atoms and first-row diatomic molecules. We show that transcorrelation improves the convergence rate to the complete basis set limit in comparison to conventional DMRG. Moreover, we study extensions of our approach that aim at reducing the cost of handling the matrix product operator representation of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian.},

Using relatively modest basis sets and computationally simple methods, total, atomization, and formation energies within near-chemical accuracy from HEAT results were obtained.

An energy of - 128.8298 hartree has been obtained from an 83-term wave function (73.5\% of the correlation energy). An analysis of the pair correlation energies shows that it is more difficult to represent the electronic correlation in {$p$}-{$p$} and {$s$}-{$p$} pairs than {$s$}-{$s$} pairs using Hylleraas functions. More experience with CI-Hy calculations on atoms containing as many as ten electrons is required before the method can compete with and give higher accuracy than the conventional CI calculations.},

However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and limited connectivity) hamper the straightforward implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. In quantum chemistry, the limited number of available qubits and gate operations is particularly restrictive since, for each molecular orbital, one needs, in general, two qubits. In this study, we propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach, which transfers -- without any approximation -- correlation from the wavefunction directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the number of resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy, near-term quantum devices. In particular, we show that the exact transcorrelated approach not only allows for more shallow circuits but also improves the convergence towards the so-called basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, therefore, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using just 4 and 6 qubits, respectively. Conventional methods require at least ten times more qubits for the same accuracy.},

  abstract = {High level electronic structure predictions of thermochemical properties and molecular structure are capable of accuracy rivaling the very best experimental measurements as a result of rapid advances in hardware, software, and methodology. Despite the progress, real world limitations require practical approaches designed for handling general chemical systems that rely on composite strategies in which a single, intractable calculation is replaced by a series of smaller calculations. As typically implemented, these approaches produce a final, or ``best,'' estimate that is constructed from one major component, fine-tuned by multiple corrections that are assumed to be additive. Though individually much smaller than the original, unmanageable computational problem, these corrections are nonetheless extremely costly. This study presents a survey of the widely varying magnitude of the most important components contributing to the atomization energies and structures of 106 small molecules. It combines large Gaussian basis sets and coupled cluster theory up to quadruple excitations for all systems. In selected cases, the effects of quintuple excitations and/or full configuration interaction were also considered. The availability of reliable experimental data for most of the molecules permits an expanded statistical analysis of the accuracy of the approach. In cases where reliable experimental information is currently unavailable, the present results are expected to provide some of the most accurate benchmark values available.},

  abstract = {We introduce in quantum mechanics a concept of {\textbackslash}textit\{rigidity\} and a concept of a {\textbackslash}textit\{pinned point\} of a wave function. The concept of a pinned point is a generalization of a familiar concept in the description of a vibrating string, while the concept of rigidity is introduced to describe the sensitivity of a wave function to changes in energy, potential, and/or external perturbation. Through these concepts and their mathematical implications, we introduce and formulate cusp conditions and cusp functions as fundamental properties of an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system with \$N{\textbackslash}ge 2\$, greatly expanding their relevance beyond the Coulombic systems. The theory provides rigorous constraints on an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system, specifically on its short-range pair correlation that is essential to a better understanding of strongly correlated systems. More broadly, the theory and the derivations presented here are part of a reconstruction of the mathematical and conceptual foundation of an \$N\$-body quantum theory, incorporating previously hidden properties and insights revealed through the concepts of rigidity and pinned points. It includes general analytic properties of a 2-body wave function versus energy and their relations to cusp conditions and cusp functions. It includes a rigorous derivation and an understanding, in terms of an emergent length scale, of the 2-particle separability in an \$(N{$>$}2)\$-body quantum system and its relations to cusp conditions. It also includes a classification of quantum systems, both 2-body and \$N\$-body, based on the universal behaviors in their short-range correlation.},

The new correlation factor is obtained from the r12 {$\approx$} 0 mathematical analysis of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian, and its analytical form is obtained such that the leading order in 1/r12 of the scalar part of the effective two-electron potential reproduces the long-range interaction of the range-separated density functional theory. The resulting correlation factor exactly imposes the cusp and is tuned by a unique parameter {$\mu$}, which controls both the depth of the coulomb hole and its typical range in r12. The transcorrelated Hamiltonian obtained with such a new correlation factor has a straightforward analytical expression depending on the same parameter {$\mu$}, and its physical contents continuously change by varying {$\mu$}: One can change from a non-divergent repulsive Hamiltonian at large {$\mu$} to a purely attractive one at small {$\mu$}. We investigate the convergence of the ground state eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of such a new transcorrelated Hamiltonian as a function of the basis set and as a function of {$\mu$} on a series of two-electron systems. We found that the convergence toward the complete basis set is much faster for quite a wide range of values of {$\mu$}. We also propose a specific value of {$\mu$}, which essentially reproduces the results obtained with the frozen Gaussian geminal introduced by Ten-no [Chem. Phys. Lett. 330, 169 (2000)].},

Building on results from other explicitly correlated methods, we discuss the role of the Jastrow factor and its functional form, as well as potential sources for size consistency errors, and arrive at Jastrow forms that allow for high accuracy calculations of the vibrational spectrum of the beryllium dimer.},

The advantage of working with wavefunctions which explicitly include electron correlation seems to outweigh the difficulties of working with a nonvariational procedure. Two arbitrary parameters, similar to the Slater orbital exponents, occur in the expansion functions used here for f(rij, ri, rj. For nearly all values of these parameters, a nine-term expansion for f(rij, ri, rj) gives at least 82\% of the correlation energy, and a 19-term expansion gives 88\%. The transcorrelated orbitals {$\varphi$} are within 6\% of the self-consistent field orbitals and arguments are given which suggest that the true transcorrelated orbitals are much closer than this. It is also suggested that the method used here and in the previously reported LiH calculations is not the best, but that the variant used in the Ne calculations is preferable. In the second part, it is demonstrated how expectation values can be determined for transcorrelated wavefunctions without having to evaluate 3N-dimensional integrals, and without using cluster expansion-type formula and approximations for them. The method used the Hellmann--Feynman formula, and this is considered reasonable because of the great accuracy of the transcorrelated wavefunction. The general agreement between the expectation values reported here for Be by this method, and those obtained by configuration-interaction-type procedures, upholds this view. The transcorrelated method can therefore be used for the ab initio determination of highly accurate energies, wavefunctions, and expectation values.},

Hence, unlike variational methods, when the transcorrelated equations are solved there is no visible monotonic convergence of any quantity. Here it is proposed that the parameters associated with the correlation part of C should be determined through the minimization of the transcorrelated variance U TC={$\langle$}(C -1 HC-W){$\Phi$}2{$\rangle$}, the orbital parameters of C and {$\Phi$} being determined by established methods. No integrals more difficult than 9-dimensional integrals are needed, and if they can be evaluated or approximated in some way, all the parameters of C{$\Phi$} can be determined through minimization procedures for any molecule. Calculations on helium are reported which certainly demonstrate the applicability of the method. As in other calculations which minimize variance, the associated energies are not quite so accurate as those when the more direct bi-variational equations are solved, but the difference is insignificant compared to the advantage of having a minimization criterion.},

We show that HCI provides an accurate treatment of both static and dynamic correlation by computing the potential energy curve of the multireference carbon dimer in the cc-pVDZ basis. We then demonstrate the speed and accuracy of HCI by recovering the full configuration interaction energy of both the carbon dimer in the cc-pVTZ basis and the strongly correlated chromium dimer in the Ahlrichs VDZ basis, correlating all electrons, to an accuracy of better than 1 mHa, in just a few minutes on a single core.

  abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are wave-function-based approaches based on random sampling that provide a very direct treatment of many-body problems and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. This thesis is concerned with the development of QMC methods for the calculation of highly-accurate electronic energies. In particular, it focusses on combining QMC methods, namely continuum methods such as variational and diffusion Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) with full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC). The principal aim of this thesis is to show that thanks to their complementary nature, these methods can be used in combination to overcome specific weaknesses that each methodology has by itself.  The thesis begins with introductory chapters which describe the various QMC methods as they are used in the literature. Following this, three different methodologies are explored, which have applicabilities to different types of systems. In the first method, we present a new technique to obtain very accurate total and relative energies by extrapolating VMC and DMC energies, with the help of FCIQMC-generated trial wave functions combined with a Jastrow factor and an optional backflow transformation. We find that the VMC and DMC energies are smooth functions of the sum of the squared coefficients in the FCIQMC wave function, and that quadratic extrapolations of the VMC and DMC energies intersect within uncertainty of the exact total energy. With adequate statistical treatment of quasi-random fluctuations, the extrapolated intersection with polynomials of order two (XSPOT) method is shown to yield results in agreement with benchmark-quality total and relative energies for various molecular systems.  Following this, we combine the DMC and transcorrelated FCIQMC (TC-FCIQMC) methods, along with a finite-size extrapolation framework to calculate the thermodynamic limit of the exact correlation energy of the high-density spin-unpolarized uniform electron gas. The thermodynamic limit obtained at rs = 0.5 is within uncertainty of the most recent QMC correlation energy from the literature.  In the final method, we introduce a new extrapolation scheme which eliminates the energy bias stemming from the initiator approximation in the FCIQMC method. We find that extrapolating the FCIQMC energy linearly in n{\textasciicircum}(-1/3) to the infinite-walker limit yields results in excellent agreement with the benchmark full configuration interaction (FCI) limits from the semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI) method. The method is applied to a series of diatomics and the results are accurate, with FCI limits obtained from FCIQMC differing by 0.4 mHa or less from their SHCI counterparts throughout. The more complex chromium atom and dimer are also successfully studied using this method.},

In order to investigate the behavior of this functional, we have also studied the correlation holes of He and Hooke atoms in detail.},

The method consists of setting up a wave function as a series in the five variables required, electronic separation being introduced explicitly as one of the variables. The coefficients are then determined so as to produce the lowest energy. The energy found is within 0.03 v.e. of the most probable experimental value, while the form and location of the potential energy curve for various internuclear distances agree with those deduced from spectra to within similar limits. The value of the function is computed for several configurations of the electrons, and compared with other approximations. Application of the method to other problems is discussed. A method is given for the numerical solution of secular equations of high degree.},

Several variants of the basic techniques are studied, including limiting the variations in the weighting factors that arise in correlated sampling estimations of the energy and its variance. We investigate the numerical stability of the techniques and identify two reasons why variance minimization exhibits superior numerical stability to energy minimization. The characteristics of each method are studied using a noninteracting 64-electron model of crystalline silicon. While our main interest is in solid-state systems, the issues investigated are relevant to Monte Carlo studies of atoms, molecules, and solids.

With these functions, three- and four-electron integrals occur, but these integrals can be avoided by inserting a resolution of the identity (RI) in terms of the one-electron basis. In previous work, only one single basis was used for both the electronic wave function and the RI approximation. In the present work, a new computational approach is developed that uses an auxiliary basis set to represent the RI. This auxiliary basis makes it possible to employ standard basis sets in explicitly correlated MP2-R12 calculations.},

  abstract = {Simulation of electronic structure is one of the most promising applications on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices. However, NISQ devices suffer from a number of challenges like limited qubit connectivity, short coherence times, and sizable gate error rates. Thus, desired quantum algorithms should require shallow circuit depths and low qubit counts to take advantage of these devices. Here, we attempt to reduce quantum resource requirements for molecular simulations on a quantum computer while maintaining the desired accuracy with the help of classical quantum chemical theories of canonical transformation and explicit correlation. In this work, compact ab initio Hamiltonians are generated classically, in the second quantized form, through an approximate similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with (a) an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator with generalized pair excitations that remove the Coulombic electron--electron singularities from the Hamiltonian and (b) a unitary one-body operator to efficiently capture the orbital relaxation effects required for accurate description of the excited states. The resulting transcorrelated Hamiltonians are able to describe both the ground and the excited states of molecular systems in a balanced manner. Using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz and only a minimal basis set (ANO-RCC-MB), we demonstrate that the transcorrelated Hamiltonians can produce ground state energies comparable to the reference CCSD energies with the much larger cc-pVTZ basis set. This leads to a reduction in the number of required CNOT gates by more than 3 orders of magnitude for the chemical species studied in this work. Furthermore, using the quantum equation of motion (qEOM) formalism in conjunction with the transcorrelated Hamiltonian, we are able to reduce the deviations in the excitation energies from the reference EOM-CCSD/cc-pVTZ values by an order of magnitude. The transcorrelated Hamiltonians developed here are Hermitian and contain only one- and two-body interaction terms and thus can be easily combined with any quantum algorithm for accurate electronic structure simulations.}

We apply this method in combination with the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method to the homogeneous electron gas. As a projection technique, the non-Hermitian nature of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian does not cause complications or numerical difficulties for FCIQMC. The rate of convergence of the total energy to the complete basis set limit is improved from O(M-1) to O(M-5/3), where M is the total number of orbital basis functions.},

For the single determinant ansatz, we obtain a Hartree--Fock type self-consistent equation for the optimization of orbitals, and for the multideterminant ansatz we have tested a CI type equation.

  abstract = {The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans{\"a}tze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H4, LiH, and H2O. In particular, H4 is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans{\"a}tze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans{\"a}tze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.},

The transcorrelated Hamiltonian used in this work is efficiently constructed classically, at polynomial cost, by an approximate similarity transformation with an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator. This Hamiltonian is Hermitian, includes no more than two-particle interactions, and is free of electron--electron singularities. We investigate the effect of such a transformed Hamiltonian on the accuracy and computational cost of quantum simulations by focusing on a widely used solver for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, namely the variational quantum eigensolver method, based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (q-UCCSD) Ansatz. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here translates straightforwardly to other quantum algorithms for chemistry. Our results demonstrate that a transcorrelated Hamiltonian, paired with extremely compact bases, produces explicitly correlated energies comparable to those from much larger bases. For the chemical species studied here, explicitly correlated energies based on an underlying 6-31G basis had cc-pVTZ quality. The use of the very compact transcorrelated Hamiltonian reduces the number of CNOT gates required to achieve cc-pVTZ quality by up to two orders of magnitude, and the number of qubits by a factor of three.},

In this method, the many-body wave function is approximated as the Jastrow-Slater type and one-electron orbitals in the Slater determinant are optimized with a one-body self-consistent-field equation such as that in the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. Although the TC method has yielded good results for both molecules and solids, its computational cost in solid-state calculations, being of order O(N k3N b3) with N k and N b the respective numbers of k-points and bands, has for some years hindered its wide application in condensed matter physics. Although an efficient algorithm was proposed for a Gaussian basis set, that algorithm is not applicable to a plane-wave basis that is suited to and widely used in solid-state calculations. In this paper, we present a new efficient algorithm of the TC method for the plane-wave basis or an arbitrary basis function set expanded in terms of plane waves, with which the computational cost of the TC method scales as O(N k2N b2). This is the same as that of the HF method. We applied the TC method with the new algorithm to obtain converged band structure and cell parameters of some semiconductors. {\copyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

We find that a position of the deep valence bands is improved by an explicit inclusion of core states, but an overall band structure is consistent with a regular setup that includes core states into the pseudopotentials. This study offers an important understanding for the future application of the TC method to strongly correlated solids.},

Conventional CIS with the Hartree--Fock wave function, while a popular method for excited-state calculations of molecular systems, cannot describe electron correlation effects, such as the screening effect in solids, resulting in inaccurate results such as overestimation of the band gap and exciton binding energy. Here, we adopt the TC method, which takes electron correlations into account through a similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian using the Jastrow factor, and combine it with the CIS approximation. We calculate the optical absorption spectra of solid LiF and GaAs as a test, and verify that the present method reproduces the spectra more accurately than the conventional HF-CIS. The excitonic effect is well described with our method.}

An extensive search for optimum exponential parameters yielded trial functions for each of the ss orbital pairs giving better than 99\% of the limiting second-order pair energy using only five basis functions per pair.

Exact wave functions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wave function approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wave-function Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wave functions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic neural network, as a powerful wave-function Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic neural network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum Monte Carlo Ansatz on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimization of wave functions for previously intractable many-electron systems.},

Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3674], by introducing a semistochastic algorithm for performing multireference Epstein--Nesbet perturbation theory, in order to completely eliminate the severe memory bottleneck of the original method. The proposed algorithm has several attractive features. First, there is no sign problem that plagues several quantum Monte Carlo methods. Second, instead of using Metropolis--Hastings sampling, we use the Alias method to directly sample determinants from the reference wave function, thus avoiding correlations between consecutive samples. Third, in addition to removing the memory bottleneck, semistochastic HCI (SHCI) is faster than the deterministic variant for many systems if a stochastic error of 0.1 mHa is acceptable. Fourth, within the SHCI algorithm one can trade memory for a modest increase in computer time. Fifth, the perturbative calculation is embarrassingly parallel. The SHCI algorithm extends the range of applicability of the original algorithm, allowing us to calculate the correlation energy of very large active spaces. We demonstrate this by performing calculations on several first row dimers including F2 with an active space of (14e, 108o), Mn-Salen cluster with an active space of (28e, 22o), and Cr2 dimer with up to a quadruple-{$\zeta$} basis set with an active space of (12e, 190o).

It is shown that this method should give a good approximation to the energy levels, and also to the wave function, except at very small distances. The attempt to use this function as a starting point for perturbation calculations is shown, however, not to be justified, for the matrix of the Hamiltonian function {$H$}, which is used in the perturbation method, greatly magnifies the errors in the wave function. Suggestions are made as to the next step in improving the method, by increasing the accuracy of the wave function for small {$r\prime$}s.},

  abstract = {We use the recently developed Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) algorithm as an efficient active space solver to perform multiconfiguration self-consistent field calculations (HCISCF) with large active spaces. We give a detailed derivation of the theory and show that difficulties associated with non-variationality of the HCI procedure can be overcome by making use of the Lagrangian formulation to calculate the HCI relaxed two-body reduced density matrix. HCISCF is then used to study the electronic structure of butadiene, pentacene, and Fe--porphyrin. One of the most striking results of our work is that the converged active space orbitals obtained from HCISCF are relatively insensitive to the accuracy of the HCI calculation. This allows us to obtain nearly converged CASSCF energies with an estimated error of less than 1 mHa using the orbitals obtained from the HCISCF procedure in which the integral transformation is the dominant cost. For example, an HCISCF calculation on the Fe--porphyrin model complex with an active space of (44e, 44o) took only 412 s per iteration on a single node containing 28 cores, out of which 185 s was spent in the HCI calculation and the remaining 227 s was used mainly for integral transformation. Finally, we also show that active space orbitals can be optimized using HCISCF to substantially speed up the convergence of the HCI energy to the Full CI limit because HCI is not invariant to unitary transformations within the active space.},

Each geminal was a product of two spherical Gaussian orbitals and a correlation factor of the form exp(-{$\gamma$}r212). Since the time-consuming terms resulting from the strong orthogonality do not appear in our functional, basis sets much larger than previous ones could be handled. The second-order energies obtained after carefully optimizing all nonlinear parameters are better than the best values published hitherto in the literature, although the improvement is marginal for He and Be. This shows that the present approach is able to match the ``basis set independent'' results available for atoms, providing at the same time a similar accuracy for small molecules. The proposed approach offers a sensible alternative to the virtual orbital expansion method customarily used in MBPT calculations, since, for obtaining a comparable accuracy, orbitals much higher than f would have to be used in expanding the pair functions.},

In the less computationally expensive perturbative method, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the generalized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal perturbation theory. These general methods are illustrated here by the optimization of wave functions consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an expansion in configuration state functions (CSFs) for the C2 molecule, including both valence and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and linear methods are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF, and orbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the optimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the optimization is performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we observe for the C2 molecule studied here, and for other systems we have studied, that as more parameters in the trial wave functions are optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo total energy improves monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also improves monotonically.},

It is found that both the first and the second excitation energies given by TC-VMC are much closer to the experimental data than those given by the variational Monte Carlo method with using the Hartree--Fock orbitals.

Since many-body integrals are inevitable there, the calculation totally depends on Monte Carlo sampling, and so, except for very simple cases, it is very difficult to optimize one-body wave functions in the Slater determinant which determine the nodal surfaces of the total wave function. Here we propose and demonstrate that the total wave function is efficiently optimized by coupling an ordinary variational Monte Carlo (VMC) technique with the transcorrelated method, in which the one-body wave functions are definitely obtained by solving Hartree--Fock-type self-consistent-field (SCF) equations derived from the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. It is shown that the present method reproduces about 90\% of the correlation energy for helium-like two-electron systems (H-, He, Li+, and Be2+) and gives much better results than the conventional VMC method using the Hartree--Fock orbitals for a Li atom, a Be atom, and a H2 molecule. It is also shown that the orbital energy appearing in the SCF equations gives a good approximation to the ionization potential.},
