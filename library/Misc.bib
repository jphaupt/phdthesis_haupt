The local exchange approximation is used, but the usual muffin-tin approximation for potentials or densities is avoided. Procedures specifically optimized for treating large systems, such as transition-metal complexes, are developed. Some illustrative results are given for small molecules. We show that one-electron energies can be calculated rapidly and that the charge distribution is also easily obtained. Total energies, and therefore optim- ized molecular geometries, require more computation time.},

  abstract = {The object of much experimentation is to find out how a number of experimental variables, such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc., affect a response, such as yield, and, in particular, to find experimentally the optimal combination of conditions that provides the highest response.  "Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" shows how to do this efficiently. Written by two practitioners and active researchers who are in the forefront of their field, the book begins from first principles and logically develops basic ideas, finally moving to a discussion of important research findings.  Numerous exercises are included; many of these feature real data sets, and all have answers. An extensive bibliography is provided. Features of the book are: [(a)] A detailed analysis and explanation of ridge maxima. This is of great practical importance because it can show alternative sets of near-optimal conditions. [(b)] A practical discussion of the considerations which should motivate the choice of an experimental design. Included is a critique of alphabetic optimality. [(c)] A summary of important results in least squares, together with the geometry necessary to provide intuitive understanding.  The tools and techniques presented in "Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" are useful to experimenters in many fields of research. Engineers, quality technologists, chemists, physicists, biologists, botanists, agricultural scientists, psychologists, as well as statisticians, will find many things of value within these pages.

It is shown that by taking Gaussian functions, and functions derived from these by differentiation with respect to the parameters, complete systems of functions can be constructed appropriate to any molecular problem, and that all the necessary integrals can be explicitly evaluated. These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required degree of accuracy is the labour of computation. A modification of the general method applicable to atoms is discussed and considered to be extremely practicable.},

  abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation\hphantom{,}consistent\hphantom{,}basis\hphantom{,}sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

  abstract = {We present a method that accurately describes strongly correlated states and captures dynamical correlation. It is derived as a modification of coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) through consideration of particle distinguishability between dissociated fragments, whilst retaining the key desirable properties of particle-hole symmetry, size extensivity, invariance to rotations within the occupied and virtual spaces, and exactness for two-electron subsystems. The resulting method, called the distinguishable cluster approximation, smoothly dissociates difficult cases such as the nitrogen molecule, with the modest N6 computational cost of CCSD. Even for molecules near their equilibrium geometries, the new model outperforms CCSD. It also accurately describes the massively correlated states encountered when dissociating hydrogen lattices, a proxy for the metal-insulator transition, and the fully dissociated system is treated exactly.},

  abstract = {The complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method has seen broad adoption due to its ability to describe the electronic structure of both the ground and excited states of molecules over a broader swath of the potential energy surface than is possible with the simpler Hartree–Fock approximation. However, it also has a reputation for being unwieldy, computationally costly, and un-black-box. Here, we discuss a class of alternatives, complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) methods, paying particular attention to their application to electronic excited states. The goal of this Perspective is fourfold. First, we argue that CASCI is not merely an approximation to CASSCF, in that it can be designed to have important qualitative advantages over CASSCF. Second, we present several insights drawn from our experience experimenting with different schemes for computing orbitals to be employed in CASCI. Third, we argue that CASCI is well suited for application to nanomaterials. Finally, we reason that, with the rise in new low-scaling approaches for describing multireference systems, there is a greater need than ever to develop new methods for defining orbitals that provide an efficient and accurate description of both static correlation and electronic excitations in a limited active space.},

This FCA is tested by performing MCSCF calculations on the six low lying states, X1Σ+, A1Σ+, a3Σ+, c3Σ+, B1Π, and b3Π of NaH. The results obtained are compared with those of an analogous previous MCSCF calculation on these states without the use of FCA, i.e., with all orbitals optimized. It is found that energies are obtained rather accurately with FCA; however, calculated molecular properties are affected more strongly and the shapes of the potential curves appear to be distorted somewhat by FCA. It is argued that no pseudo‐ or model‐potential calculation can give errors less than FCA unless the potential is made valence shell dependent. This, however, would be analogous to a full calculation, and the savings due to a pseudopotential approximation would be lost.},

The Rydberg formula follows from this as in the older theory. The separate Rydberg series for the various multiplets also are explained. The method previously applied by the writer to the helium problem appears as a next approximation, in which the outer electron moves, not in a hydrogen-like field, but in a somewhat more accurate central field. It is shown that this method should give a good approximation to the energy levels, and also to the wave function, except at very small distances. The attempt to use this function as a starting point for perturbation calculations is shown, however, not to be justified, for the matrix of the Hamiltonian function 𝐻, which is used in the perturbation method, greatly magnifies the errors in the wave function. Suggestions are made as to the next step in improving the method, by increasing the accuracy of the wave function for small 𝑟′s.},

In addition to a universal, particle dependent term, a system and state dependent term arises in the higher order conditions, which we interpret as an effect of Coulombic screening.

Two crucial applications are presented to demonstrate the validity and robustness of this scheme: the 1Δg ← 3Σg vertical excitation in O2 and key spin gaps in a [Mn3(IV)O4] cluster. In the absence of a robust spin adaptation/purification technique, both applications would be unattainable by Slater determinant based ground state methods, with any starting wave function collapsing into the higher-spin ground state during the optimization. This strategy can be coupled to other algorithms that use the Slater determinant based FCIQMC algorithm as configuration interaction eigensolver, including the Stochastic Generalized Active Space, the similarity-transformed FCIQMC, the tailored-CC, and second-order perturbation theory approaches. Moreover, in contrast to the GUGA-FCIQMC technique, this strategy features both spin projection and total spin adaptation, making it appealing when solving anisotropic Hamiltonians. It also provides spin-resolved reduced density matrices, important for the investigation of spin-dependent properties in polynuclear transition metal clusters, such as the hyperfine-coupling constants.},
