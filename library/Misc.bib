  abstract = {The object of much experimentation is to find out how a number of experimental variables, such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc., affect a response, such as yield, and, in particular, to find experimentally the optimal combination of conditions that provides the highest response.  "Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" shows how to do this efficiently. Written by two practitioners and active researchers who are in the forefront of their field, the book begins from first principles and logically develops basic ideas, finally moving to a discussion of important research findings.  Numerous exercises are included; many of these feature real data sets, and all have answers. An extensive bibliography is provided. Features of the book are: [(a)] A detailed analysis and explanation of ridge maxima. This is of great practical importance because it can show alternative sets of near-optimal conditions. [(b)] A practical discussion of the considerations which should motivate the choice of an experimental design. Included is a critique of alphabetic optimality. [(c)] A summary of important results in least squares, together with the geometry necessary to provide intuitive understanding.  The tools and techniques presented in "Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" are useful to experimenters in many fields of research. Engineers, quality technologists, chemists, physicists, biologists, botanists, agricultural scientists, psychologists, as well as statisticians, will find many things of value within these pages.

  abstract = {The analogy in wave mechanics is set up for the non-penetrating part of the electron orbits on the older theory, in which the motion of the outer electron is like that in the field of a point charge. The Rydberg formula follows from this as in the older theory. The separate Rydberg series for the various multiplets also are explained. The method previously applied by the writer to the helium problem appears as a next approximation, in which the outer electron moves, not in a hydrogen-like field, but in a somewhat more accurate central field. It is shown that this method should give a good approximation to the energy levels, and also to the wave function, except at very small distances. The attempt to use this function as a starting point for perturbation calculations is shown, however, not to be justified, for the matrix of the Hamiltonian function ùêª, which is used in the perturbation method, greatly magnifies the errors in the wave function. Suggestions are made as to the next step in improving the method, by increasing the accuracy of the wave function for small ùëü‚Ä≤s.},

  abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate that a first-order spin penalty scheme can be efficiently applied to the Slater determinant based Full-CI Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) algorithm, as a practical route toward spin purification. Two crucial applications are presented to demonstrate the validity and robustness of this scheme: the 1Œîg ‚Üê 3Œ£g vertical excitation in O2 and key spin gaps in a [Mn3(IV)O4] cluster. In the absence of a robust spin adaptation/purification technique, both applications would be unattainable by Slater determinant based ground state methods, with any starting wave function collapsing into the higher-spin ground state during the optimization. This strategy can be coupled to other algorithms that use the Slater determinant based FCIQMC algorithm as configuration interaction eigensolver, including the Stochastic Generalized Active Space, the similarity-transformed FCIQMC, the tailored-CC, and second-order perturbation theory approaches. Moreover, in contrast to the GUGA-FCIQMC technique, this strategy features both spin projection and total spin adaptation, making it appealing when solving anisotropic Hamiltonians. It also provides spin-resolved reduced density matrices, important for the investigation of spin-dependent properties in polynuclear transition metal clusters, such as the hyperfine-coupling constants.},
