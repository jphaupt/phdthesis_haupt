  abstract = {We expand upon the recent semi-stochastic adaptation to full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC). We present an alternate method for generating the deterministic space without a priori knowledge of the wave function and present stochastic efficiencies for a variety of both molecular and lattice systems. The algorithmic details of an efficient semi-stochastic implementation are presented, with particular consideration given to the effect that the adaptation has on parallel performance in FCIQMC. We further demonstrate the benefit for calculation of reduced density matrices in FCIQMC through replica sampling, where the semi-stochastic adaptation seems to have even larger efficiency gains. We then combine these ideas to produce explicitly correlated corrected FCIQMC energies for the beryllium dimer, for which stochastic errors on the order of wavenumber accuracy are achievable.

  abstract = {We present a quantum Monte Carlo method capable of sampling the full density matrix of a many-particle system at finite temperature. This allows arbitrary reduced density matrix elements and expectation values of complicated nonlocal observables to be evaluated easily. The method resembles full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo but works in the space of many-particle operators instead of the space of many-particle wave functions. One simulation provides the density matrix at all temperatures simultaneously, from ùëá=‚àû to ùëá=0, allowing the temperature dependence of expectation values to be studied. The direct sampling of the density matrix also allows the calculation of some previously inaccessible entanglement measures. We explain the theory underlying the method, describe the algorithm, and introduce an importance-sampling procedure to improve the stochastic efficiency. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, the energy and staggered magnetization of the isotropic antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on small lattices, the concurrence of one-dimensional spin rings, and the Renyi ùëÜ2 entanglement entropy of various sublattices of the 6√ó6 Heisenberg model are calculated. The nature of the sign problem in the method is also investigated.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach to calculate excited states with the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method. The approach uses a Gram-Schmidt procedure, instantaneously applied to the stochastically evolving distributions of walkers, to orthogonalize higher energy states against lower energy ones. It can thus be used to study several of the lowest-energy states of a system within the same symmetry. This additional step is particularly simple and computationally inexpensive, requiring only a small change to the underlying FCIQMC algorithm. No trial wave functions or partitioning of the space is needed. The approach should allow excited states to be studied for systems similar to those accessible to the ground-state method due to a comparable computational cost. As a first application, we consider the carbon dimer in basis sets up to quadruple-zeta quality and compare to existing results where available. C 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.},

  abstract = {For many decades, quantum chemical method development has been dominated by algorithms which involve increasingly complex series of tensor contractions over one-electron orbital spaces. Procedures for their derivation and implementation have evolved to require the minimum amount of logic and rely heavily on computationally efficient library-based matrix algebra and optimised paging schemes. In this regard, the recent development of exact stochastic quantum chemical algorithms to reduce computational scaling and memory overhead requires a contrasting algorithmic philosophy, but one which when implemented efficiently can achieve higher accuracy/cost ratios with small random errors. Additionally, they can exploit the continuing trend for massive parallelisation which hinders the progress of deterministic high-level quantum chemical algorithms. In the Quantum Monte Carlo community, stochastic algorithms are ubiquitous but the discrete Fock space of quantum chemical methods is often unfamiliar, and the methods introduce new concepts required for algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we explore these concepts and detail an algorithm used for Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which is implemented and available in MOLPRO and as a standalone code, and is designed for high-level parallelism and linear-scaling with walker number. Many of the algorithms are also in use in, or can be transferred to, other stochastic quantum chemical methods and implementations. We apply these algorithms to the strongly correlated chromium dimer to demonstrate their efficiency and parallelism.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr√∂dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods-a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O2, CH4, and NaH-with FCI spaces ranging from 109 to 1014, whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources. ¬© 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N2 molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 1015 with very modest computational resources. ¬© 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

Random excitation generation and matrix element calculation on the Shavitt graph of GUGA can be efficiently implemented via a biasing procedure on the branching diagram. The use of a spin-pure basis explicitly resolves the different spin-sectors and ensures that the stochastically sampled wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the total spin operator S\textasciicircum 2. The method allows for the calculation of states with low or intermediate spin in systems dominated by Hund‚Äôs first rule, which are otherwise generally inaccessible. Furthermore, in systems with small spin gaps, the new methodology enables much more rapid convergence with respect to walker number and simulation time. Some illustrative applications of the GUGA-FCIQMC method are provided: computation of the 2F ‚àí 4F spin gap of the cobalt atom in large basis sets, achieving chemical accuracy to experiment, and the Œ£g+1, Œ£g+3, Œ£g+5, and Œ£g+7 spin-gaps of the stretched N2 molecule, an archetypal strongly correlated system.},

This allows us to use GUGA-FCIQMC as a spin-pure configuration interaction (CI) eigensolver within the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) procedure and hence to stochastically treat active spaces far larger than conventional CI solvers while variationally relaxing orbitals for specific spin-pure states. We apply the method to investigate the spin ladder in iron‚Äìsulfur dimer and tetramer model systems. We demonstrate the importance of the orbital relaxation by comparing the Heisenberg model magnetic coupling parameters from the CASSCF procedure to those from a CI-only (CASCI) procedure based on restricted open-shell Hartree‚ÄìFock orbitals. We show that the orbital relaxation differentially stabilizes the lower-spin states, thus enlarging the coupling parameters with respect to the values predicted by ignoring orbital relaxation effects. Moreover, we find that, while CASCI results are well fit by a simple bilinear Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the CASSCF eigenvalues exhibit deviations that necessitate the inclusion of biquadratic terms in the model Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {We identify and rectify a crucial source of bias in the initiator full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Noninitiator determinants (i.e., determinants whose population is below the initiator threshold) are subject to a systematic undersampling bias, which in large systems leads to a bias in the energy when an insufficient number of walkers are used. We show that the acceptance probability (pacc), that a noninitiator determinant has its spawns accepted, can be used to unbias the initiator bias, in a simple and accurate manner, by reducing the applied shift to the noninitiator proportionately to pacc. This modification preserves the property that in the large walker limit, when pacc ‚Üí 1, the unbiasing procedure disappears, and the initiator approximation becomes exact. We demonstrate that this algorithm shows rapid convergence to the FCI limit with respect to the walker number and, furthermore, largely removes the dependence of the algorithm on the initiator threshold, enabling highly accurate results to be obtained even with large values of the threshold. This is exemplified in the case of butadiene/ANO-L-pVDZ and benzene/cc-pVDZ, correlating 22 and 30 electrons in 82 and 108 orbitals, respectively. In butadiene 5 √ó 107 and in benzene 108 walkers suffice to obtain an energy within a millihartree of the coupled cluster singles doubles triples and perturbative quadruples [CCSDT(Q)] result in Hilbert spaces of 1026 and 1035, respectively. Essentially converged results require ‚àº108 walkers for butadiene and ‚àº109 walkers for benzene and lie slightly lower than CCSDT(Q). Owing to large-scale parallelizability, these calculations can be executed in a matter of hours on a few hundred processors. The present method largely solves the initiator-bias problems that the initiator method suffered from when applied to medium-sized molecules.},

Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 1561-1571.] dramatically increases the efficiency of the spawn step of such algorithms but requires memory storage scaling quartically with system size which can be prohibitive for large systems. Alternatively, Alavi et al. [Smart, S. D.; Booth, G. H.; Alavi, A. Unpublished results.] approximated these weights with weights based on Cauchy-Schwarz-like inequalities calculated on-the-fly. While reducing the memory cost, this algorithm scales linearly in system size computationally. We combine both of these ideas with the single-reference nature of many systems studied and introduce a spawn-sampling algorithm that has low memory requirements (quadratic in basis set size) compared to the heat bath algorithm and only scales either independently of system size (CCMC) or linearly in the number of electrons (FCIQMC) that works especially well on localized orbitals. Tests on small water chains with localized orbitals with CCMC and with an initiator point sample in FCIQMC indicate that it can be equally efficient as the other excitation generators. As the system gets larger, calculations with our new algorithm converge faster than the on-the-fly weight algorithm while having a much more favorable memory scaling than the heat bath algorithm.},

This is achieved via an independent replica population of walkers in the dynamic, sampled alongside the original population. The resulting reduced density matrices are free from systematic error (beyond those present via constraints on the dynamic itself) and can be used to compute a variety of expectation values and properties, with rapid convergence to an exact limit. A quasi-variational energy estimate derived from these density matrices is proposed as an accurate alternative to the projected estimator for multiconfigurational wavefunctions, while its variational property could potentially lend itself to accurate extrapolation approaches in larger systems. },

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an improved excitation generation algorithm for the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo method, which is particularly effective in systems described by localized orbitals. The method is an extension of the precomputed heat-bath strategy of Holmes et al., with more effective sampling of double excitations and a novel approach for nonuniform sampling of single excitations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for a chain of 30 hydrogen atoms with atom-localized orbitals, a stack of benzene molecules, and an Fe(II)-porphyrin model complex, whereby we show an overall efficiency gain by a factor of two to four, as measured by variance reduction per wall-clock time.},

  abstract = {An algorithm to perform stochastic generalized active space calculations, Stochastic-GAS, is presented, that uses the Slater determinant based FCIQMC algorithm as configuration interaction eigensolver. Stochastic-GAS allows the construction and stochastic optimization of preselected truncated configuration interaction wave functions, either to reduce the computational costs of large active space wave function optimizations, or to probe the role of specific electron correlation pathways. As for the conventional GAS procedure, the preselection of the truncated wave function is based on the selection of multiple active subspaces while imposing restrictions on the interspace excitations. Both local and cumulative minimum and maximum occupation number constraints are supported by Stochastic-GAS. The occupation number constraints are efficiently encoded in precomputed probability distributions, using the precomputed heat bath algorithm, which removes nearly all runtime overhead of GAS. This strategy effectively allows the FCIQMC dynamics to a priori exclude electronic configurations that are not allowed by GAS restrictions. Stochastic-GAS reduced density matrices are stochastically sampled, allowing orbital relaxations via Stochastic-GASSCF, and direct evaluation of properties that can be extracted from density matrices, such as the spin expectation value. Three test case applications have been chosen to demonstrate the flexibility of Stochastic-GAS: (a) the Stochastic-GASSCF [5¬∑(6, 6)] optimization of a stack of five benzene molecules, that shows the applicability of Stochastic-GAS toward fragment-based chemical systems; (b) an uncontracted stochastic MRCISD calculation that correlates 96 electrons and 159 molecular orbitals, and uses a large (32, 34) active space reference wave function for an Fe(II)-porphyrin model system, showing how GAS can be applied to systematically recover dynamic electron correlation, and how in the specific case of the Fe(II)-porphyrin dynamic correlation further differentially stabilizes the 3Eg over the 5A1g spin state; (c) the study of an Fe4S4 cluster‚Äôs spin-ladder energetics via highly truncated stochastic-GAS [4¬∑(5, 5)] wave functions, where we show how GAS can be applied to understand the competing spin-exchange and charge-transfer correlating mechanisms in stabilizing different spin-states.},
