  abstract = {Internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (icMRCC) theory is embedded within multireference perturbation theory (MRPT) to calculate energy differences in large strongly correlated systems. The embedding scheme is based on partitioning the orbital spaces of a complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) wave function, with a truncated virtual space constructed by transforming selected projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). MRPT is applied to the environment using a subtractive embedding approach that also allows for multilayer embedding. Benchmark calculations are presented for biradical bond dissociation, spin splitting in a heterocyclic carbene and hydrated Fe(II), and for the super-exchange coupling constant in solid nickel oxide. The method is further applied to two large transition metal complexes with a triple-ζ basis set: an iron complex with 175 atoms and 2939 basis functions, and a nickel complex with 231 atoms, and 4175 basis functions.},

  abstract = {It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d - and f -bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

  abstract = {We present a method that accurately describes strongly correlated states and captures dynamical correlation. It is derived as a modification of coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) through consideration of particle distinguishability between dissociated fragments, whilst retaining the key desirable properties of particle-hole symmetry, size extensivity, invariance to rotations within the occupied and virtual spaces, and exactness for two-electron subsystems. The resulting method, called the distinguishable cluster approximation, smoothly dissociates difficult cases such as the nitrogen molecule, with the modest N6 computational cost of CCSD. Even for molecules near their equilibrium geometries, the new model outperforms CCSD. It also accurately describes the massively correlated states encountered when dissociating hydrogen lattices, a proxy for the metal-insulator transition, and the fully dissociated system is treated exactly. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

  abstract = {Full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) is an electronic structure method that has been applied to a variety of ab initio molecular and solid-state systems as well as the Hubbard model in delocalised bases. In this thesis, the behaviour of FCIQMC in the Hubbard model in the real-space formulation is investigated. A special emphasis is put on the consequences of the fermionic sign problem. Firstly, a classification of Hubbard lattice geometries based on their strength of the sign problem is performed. It is discovered that the commonly used ground state of the so-called stoquastic version of the Hamiltonian is not a good predictor for the difficulty to resolve the sign problem in FCIQMC in general. The notion of size-extensive and non-size-extensive behaviour of the sign problem is established. It is shown that although the vast majority of non-trivial fermionic systems suffer from the fermion sign problem when attempting to solve them using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, there are certain system configurations in the Hubbard model systems that are sign-problem-free. In principle, this allows for the unbiased treatment of systems with very large Hilbert space sizes in FCIQMC. However, attempting to solve these systems uncovers a new systematic bias in the FCIQMC algorithm, the population control bias. This is a bias that has been observed previously in other QMC methods, like diffusion Monte Carlo. A method that allows for the removal of this bias entirely with negligible computational overhead, mainly through introducing importance sampling to FCIQMC, is presented. This allows for the calculation of ground-state energies of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with up to 150 sites at and close to half-filling in the difficult intermediate interaction regime. Also, the fundamental many-particle gaps between the ground states of the half-filled and the system with one hole are calculated for up to 102 sites. Moving to sign-problematic systems, it is shown that the usual method of controlling the sign problem in FCIQMC, the initiator method, performs poorly in weakly sign-problematic Hubbard systems. Instead, it is demonstrated how applying the newly developed importance-sampled FCIQMC together with the exact non-initiator algorithm greatly reduces the minimum number of walkers necessary to obtain an unbiased ground-state energy in real-space Hubbard models. This allows for the calculation of numerically exact ground-state energies for width-two Hubbard ladders - which exhibit a size-extensive yet very weak sign problem - in the intermediate interaction regime at half-filling and with one hole. Again, this makes the calculation of the fundamental many-particle gaps possible. Finally, to deal with full two-dimensional Hubbard systems, a way to define fixed initiator subspaces in FCIQMC based on analytic wavefunction ansatzes is presented. This leads to far superior results compared to the usual population-based initiator criterion. Additionally, the newly developed two-shift method allows for the perturbative inclusion of the entire non-initiator space. This new scheme is shown to be compatible with importance sampling. Furthermore, an extrapolation scheme to the exact ground-state energy is presented. This allows for the estimation of the ground-state energy for systems up to 32 sites in the honeycomb lattice geometry.},

  abstract = {Accurate and predictive computations of the quantum-mechanical behavior of many interacting electrons in realistic atomic environments are critical for the theoretical design of materials with desired properties, and they require solving the grand-challenge problem of the many-electron Schrödinger equation. An infinite chain of equispaced hydrogen atoms is perhaps the simplest realistic model for a bulk material, embodying several central themes of modern condensed-matter physics and chemistry while retaining a connection to the paradigmatic Hubbard model. Here, we report a combined application of cutting-edge computational methods to determine the properties of the hydrogen chain in its quantum-mechanical ground state. Varying the separation between the nuclei leads to a rich phase diagram, including a Mott phase with quasi-long-range antiferromagnetic order, electron density dimerization with power-law correlations, an insulator-to-metal transition, and an intricate set of intertwined magnetic orders.},
