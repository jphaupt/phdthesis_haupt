  abstract = {Formulae are obtained for the distribution function f(r12) of the interelectronic distance r12 in the ground state of helium, and for the mean value of any positive integral power of r12. Five different wave functions are considered, showing varying degrees of electron correlation. The greater the degree of correlation the larger is the mean electronic separation. Curves of f(r12) are plotted, and from them the size and depth of the Coulomb hole are evaluated. There is a close correlation between the mean value of 1/r12 and the error in the energy as calculated with these five wave functions.},

  abstract = {We introduce in quantum mechanics a concept of \textbackslash textit\{rigidity\} and a concept of a \textbackslash textit\{pinned point\} of a wave function. The concept of a pinned point is a generalization of a familiar concept in the description of a vibrating string, while the concept of rigidity is introduced to describe the sensitivity of a wave function to changes in energy, potential, and/or external perturbation. Through these concepts and their mathematical implications, we introduce and formulate cusp conditions and cusp functions as fundamental properties of an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system with \$N\textbackslash ge 2\$, greatly expanding their relevance beyond the Coulombic systems. The theory provides rigorous constraints on an arbitrary \$N\$-body quantum system, specifically on its short-range pair correlation that is essential to a better understanding of strongly correlated systems. More broadly, the theory and the derivations presented here are part of a reconstruction of the mathematical and conceptual foundation of an \$N\$-body quantum theory, incorporating previously hidden properties and insights revealed through the concepts of rigidity and pinned points. It includes general analytic properties of a 2-body wave function versus energy and their relations to cusp conditions and cusp functions. It includes a rigorous derivation and an understanding, in terms of an emergent length scale, of the 2-particle separability in an \$(N{$>$}2)\$-body quantum system and its relations to cusp conditions. It also includes a classification of quantum systems, both 2-body and \$N\$-body, based on the universal behaviors in their short-range correlation.},

Based on the GCCs, a new method is proposed to determine parameters in a trial wave function. We named them GCC constrained (GCCC) method. Using the GCCC method combined with the FC wave function, we could obtain the exact wave function that behaves correctly in the coalescence point.},

These results prove numerically that with the free ICI method, we can calculate the solutions of the Schrödinger equation as accurately as one desires. We examined several types of scaling function g and initial function ψ0 of the free ICI method. The performance was good when logarithm functions were used in the initial function because the logarithm function is physically essential for three-particle collision area. The best performance was obtained when we introduce a new logarithm function containing not only r1 and r2 but also r12 in the same logarithm function.},

This leads us to propose an improved weak orthogonality functional where the explicitly correlated pair functions are almost orthogonal to the occupied orbitals by construction. For applications where 95\%-98\% accuracy in the total correlation energy is sufficient, we recommend use of the strong orthogonality functional in combination with the resolution of the identity for three- and four-electron integral evaluations.},

The results indicate that the correlation energy is associated with two effects, namely that of the "correlation hole" as has been observed for He and that of "orbital degeneracy" (which does not appear in the two-electron He case). The former effect is best handled by the Hylleraas approach and the latter by the configuration interaction method, and the results suggest that an admixture of the two methods would lead to the most rapidly convergent description of the exact four-electron wave function. The errors introduced by handling "high-lying" configurations by second-order perturbation theory rather than by exact configuration interaction are also investigated.},

  abstract = {The ground-state wave functions of the helium, lithium, and beryllium atoms were approximated by a superposition of configurations with expansion lengths ranging from 35 for helium to 55 for beryllium. The discrepancies in the total energy are 0.014 ev for helium, 0.026 ev for lithium, and 0.17 ev for beryllium. A 19-configuration function was also applied to the lowest 3𝑆 state of helium, with a resulting accuracy of 0.0005 ev. The calculations were also made on all the isoelectronic series of ions through 𝑍=8, the discrepancy remaining of the same order of magnitude but increasing with increasing 𝑍. A lower bound to the electron affinity of lithium is set at 0.4773 ev, with the most probable value, obtained by extrapolating the isoelectronic series, being placed at 0.62 ev.},
