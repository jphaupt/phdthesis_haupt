\section{Introduction}

\section{Jastrow Factor}

\section{Optimisation Strategy}

\subsection{Choosing an Appropriate Sample Size}

\section{Results}
\todo{mention details about integration will be in a separate chapter}
\todo{mention we use a walker number extrapolation already described in another dissertation (cite Muhammedreza)}

\subsection{Neglecting Three-Body Excitations}

\subsection{Basis Set Convergence}

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\todo{mention this is the way we now optimise Jastrow factors, but there is an important extension to the no-3-body approximation, xTC. Briefly describe.}
\subsection{The xTC Approximation}
