  abstract = {We describe a scheme for optimizing many-electron trial wave functions by minimizing the unreweighted variance of the energy using stochastic integration and correlated-sampling techniques. The scheme is restricted to parameters that are linear in the exponent of a Jastrow correlation factor, which are the most important parameters in the wave functions we use. The scheme is highly efficient and allows us to investigate the parameter space more closely than has been possible before. We search for multiple minima of the variance in the parameter space and compare the wave functions obtained using reweighted and unreweighted variance minimization.},

  abstract = {This article describes the variational and fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods and how they may be used to calculate the properties of many-electron systems. These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters. CONTENTS},

  abstract = {A simple scheme is described for introducing the correct cusps at nuclei into orbitals obtained from Gaussian basis set electronic structure calculations. The scheme is tested with all-electron variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) methods for the Ne atom, the H2 molecule, and 55 molecules from a standard benchmark set. It greatly reduces the variance of the local energy in all cases and slightly improves the variational energy. This scheme yields a general improvement in the efficiency of all-electron VMC and DMC calculations using Gaussian basis sets.},

  abstract = {A simple method is presented which ensures the electron-nucleus cusp condition is satisfied by the Slater-Jastrow wavefunctions commonly employed in quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The method is applied in variational energy calculations of the neon atom and a selection of molecules using both Gaussian and Slater basis sets. In addition, we discuss the relationship between the electron-nucleus cusps and the variance of forces, and investigate the sensitivity of forces to the quality of the cusps for various diatomic molecules.},
