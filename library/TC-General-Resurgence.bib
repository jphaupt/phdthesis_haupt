  abstract = {Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. In addition, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing us to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present an extension of popular selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms to the Transcorrelated (TC) framework. Although we used in this work the recently introduced one-parameter correlation factor [E. Giner, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 084119 (2021)], the theory presented here is valid for any correlation factor. Thanks to the formalization of the non-Hermitian TC eigenvalue problem as a search of stationary points for a specific functional depending on both left- and right-functions, we obtain a general framework, allowing for different choices for both the selection criterion in SCI and the second order perturbative correction to the energy. After numerical investigations on different second-row atomic and molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets, we found that taking into account the non-Hermitian character of the TC Hamiltonian in the selection criterion is mandatory to obtain a fast convergence of the TC energy. In addition, selection criteria based on either the first order coefficient or the second order energy lead to significantly different convergence rates, which is typically not the case in the usual Hermitian SCI. Regarding the convergence of the total second order perturbation energy, we find that the quality of the left-function used in the equations strongly affects the quality of the results. Within the near-optimal algorithm proposed here, we find that the SCI expansion in the TC framework converges faster than the usual SCI in terms of both the basis set and the number of Slater determinants.},

  abstract = {Explicitly correlated calculations using the transcorrelated Hamiltonian are performed at the level of linearized coupled cluster (LCC) theory. Two different reference functions are employed in the calculations and the results are compared with those of the conventional LCC. The application to the water molecule shows a markedly better convergence of the correlation energies when the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is used than in the conventional approach. We also present results for some other ten-electron systems, Ne, HF, NH3, and CH4.}

A method to obtain TC wavefunctions was developed based on the mathematical framework of the bi-variational principle. This involves the construction of an effective TC Hamiltonian matrix, which can be solved in a self-consistent manner. This was optimized using a method we call second-order-moment minimization and demonstrate that it is possible to obtain highly accurate energies for some closed-shell atoms and helium-like ions. The effects of certain correlator terms on the description of electron–electron and electron–nuclear cusps were also examined graphically, and some TC wavefunctions were compared against near-exact Hylleraas wavefunctions.},

  abstract = {A new wavefunction-based method of electronic band structure calculation of solids is proposed based on the transcorrelated (TC) method. In the TC method, a Jastrow–Slater-type correlated wavefunction is used as a trial function. Similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with respect to the Jastrow correlation function is utilized to derive Hartree–Fock (HF)-like self-consistent-field (SCF) equations, which determine the one-body wavefunctions in the Slater determinant and their orbital energies. Since the electron correlation is taken into account, the method could be a practical tool for band structure calculation of solids where the HF method fails even qualitatively. The single-particle energy dispersion of the electron gas shows no singularity at the Fermi surface due to the screening effect incorporated in the TC method. It is also demonstrated that this method significantly reduces the band gaps of Si, C, and SiC when compared with their corresponding Hartree–Fock values.},

  abstract = {We develop a feasible transcorrelated method for accelerating the convergence of reproducing the dynamic correlation effects with the size of one-electron basis. The effective Hamiltonian is parameterized in such a way that the Coulomb repulsion is compensated at short inter-electronic distances in terms of a frozen Gaussian geminal. The geminal is chosen to be independent of the position and orientation of pair-electrons. The extra part of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is also short-ranged, size-consistent, and universal to the states of interest. We preliminarily applied the method to the single-reference many body perturbation theory with some pilot calculations.}

The method is based on the transcorrelated (TC) method originally proposed by S. F. Boys and N. C. Handy about 40 years ago for atoms and molecules. In the TC method, one-electron orbitals in a Slater-Jastrow-type many-body wave funtion are fully optimized by solving a mean-field wave equation self-consistently. It is shown that the Hubbard model and also first-principles Hamiltonian can be treated accurately with this simple and tractable method.},

  abstract = {A Jastrow–Slater-type wave function is often used as a trial function for precise calculations of the total energy of electronic systems, where the correlation effect is taken into account by the Jastrow factor that directly depends on the distance between electrons. Since many-body integrals are inevitable there, the calculation totally depends on Monte Carlo sampling, and so, except for very simple cases, it is very difficult to optimize one-body wave functions in the Slater determinant which determine the nodal surfaces of the total wave function. Here we propose and demonstrate that the total wave function is efficiently optimized by coupling an ordinary variational Monte Carlo (VMC) technique with the transcorrelated method, in which the one-body wave functions are definitely obtained by solving Hartree–Fock-type self-consistent-field (SCF) equations derived from the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. It is shown that the present method reproduces about 90\% of the correlation energy for helium-like two-electron systems (H−, He, Li+, and Be2+) and gives much better results than the conventional VMC method using the Hartree–Fock orbitals for a Li atom, a Be atom, and a H2 molecule. It is also shown that the orbital energy appearing in the SCF equations gives a good approximation to the ionization potential.},
